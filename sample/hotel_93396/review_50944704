My husband and i have just returned from a wonderful 5 nights in NYC
We booked into the Iroquois after our inital hotel got some very bad reviews
On arrival at this hidden gem we were treated like royalty
The hotel is a member of the small leading hotels of the world group so you know that the standards are high already
New york was our delayed honeymoon so the hotel upgraded us to a much larger room with a huge bathroom
The complimentary wine and water was a lovely touch as were the chocolates placed on our pillow at turndown every night
The Frette linens
bathrobes and slippers were lovely and the huge bed was like sleeping on a cloud
Our shoes were shone every night if required and the new york times newspaper was delivered to the door every morning
The great free coffee every morning was just the thing to start us off before exploring the city
Our room was quiet
spacious and extremely clean and luxurious
The molton brown toiletries were a hit
The staff were amazing and couldn't do enough for us
'Antonio' was fabulous
The hotel restaurant 'Triomphe' is one of the best places to dine in NYC and we had a great meal there
This little boutique hotel is a gem and we tried to find fault with it and couldn't
The location is the best and we can't wait to go back next year
