We where staying to do some sightseeing and shopping and catch a show.
The location means 5 min from Broadway, 10 min from Central Park and close to metro.
We travelled all over the city but always experienced the location as easy to get to and did a lot on food.
The room was clean with good appointed bathroom and important clean and comfortable beds (rooms are smaller but size was not a problem). 
Staff was very pleasant. Present to help but never pushy and provided some real advice.
Pick up or delivery to airport was arranged well at reasonable price.
Wireless internet could be improved but it did work. 
We will most certainly return to this hotel. Highly recommended
