first time in NY and couldnt have picked a better hotel
location was perfect
within walking distance to most sights
friendly staff and good room
Dont expect views from the windows but perfectly adequate because youre only sleeping in there
Diner 2 mins down same road for great inexpensive breakfast
Quiet location
Very helpful staff
Would go back again
