If stayed in numerous hotels in the city and have finally found my home away from home. Hotel is on 44th which is great location. Close to museums and shopping on 5th. Bryant Park and the New York City Public Library are a block away. Times Square is a couple of blocks west.
If you dine at Triomphe, be sure and order the Scallop appetizer and the Rack of Lamb. Wine list is also impressive.
Staff was great. Concierge was helpful. Bell hop walked me to a shoe repair shop upt the block when my heel broke. Shoe shine service was good. They even let me check in early at noon. Cleaning and turdown service was very good and attentive to detail. I also enjoyed having the Times delivered to my door daily. They also work with a great executive shuttle service to and from airports. Ask for Martin,
The Hotel has a boutique charm. The rooms are somewhat small, but the amenities were great! Molton Brown toiletries and down pillows and comforters. The beds were super-comfy and the linens were very nice. The rooms were also extremely quiet. I stayed right across the hall from the elevator and only heard people a couple of times. Mini bar is nicely stocked and wine key came in handy for the bottle I purchased at the market on 42nd. Oh yeah they also put chocolates on your pillow every night! The free wi-fi had a strong signal.
You get a great value for your money along with friendly staff and good location. I won't stay anywhere else.
