I stayed her in January 09 for 4 nights with my fiancee as i was looking for a special hotel to get engaged in and this was ideal. Fantastic location and great price we found through the hotel website.
Arrived to a luxurious entrance and allocated a gorgeous 8th floor room which was perfect for our stay. Not a huge room but in New York, you don't get a huge room unless you pay a premium and how long do u stay in the room for!!!
Didn't use any of the hotel facilities but the bed was turned down every night with a choclate left and weather update on the pillows which was a lovely touch,
This hotel is a must for anyone who is visiting New York, the best hotel i have found yet
