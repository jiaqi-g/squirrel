Just arrived back from a weekend in New York with my Mum.
The Hotel Iroquois is in a fantastic location 4 mins walk from Times Square allowing you to walk to many destinations easily!.
The hotel staff were pleasant & friendly & we appreciated the nice little touches such as a card with the weather forecast for the next day left on the pillow, chocolates and the turn down service.
We had a classic twin & the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in! The room was very clean & tastefully decorated with a wonderful flat screen TV. After a tiring day it was like coming back to a home from home.
The free internet access in the library & the wonderful coffee in reception in the morning were a plus.
We had a fantastic time & I would definitely stay at The Iroquois next time I am in New York.
