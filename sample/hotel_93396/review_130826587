This was a return trip to NYC. First trip two years ago was with the family and was well served by the staff at the Iroquois. This trip was a 'sans-kids' getaway and again the Iroquois did not disapoint. We were warmly greeted by the bell staff and registration desk. The room was well appointed. The highlight though was the staff. From the servers in the lounge, to the desk clerks, bell staff and concierge, all made us feel we were the most important thing they needed to take care of that day. The advice for restaurants, transport and entertainment was first rate. And as has been mentioned in numerous posts the location is perfect. We are definitely looking forward to returning to NYC and The Iroquois.
