We had a wonderful stay at the Iroquois for 4 nights at the beginning of November
The hotel is clean and well decorated throughout
with very pleasant and helpful staff
Superb location
on west 44th Street between 5th & 6th Avenue next to the Sofitel and Algonquin hotels
A 3 minute walk takes you to the heart of Times Square or 5th Avenue
with many other sites within easy walking distance
The rooms were a little on the small side (but I understand most in New York are) but the bed was so comfortable and the marble bathroom equipped with Molton Brown toiletries
it was a pleasure to come back from a day's shopping/site seeing for a soak or just to relax
We didn't eat in the restaurant but it also looked very nice
(There is a diner just a couple of doors away that has an excellent menu
especially for breakfast)
I would definitely stay here again on my next trip and would recommend it to everybody
