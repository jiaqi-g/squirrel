My partner and I stayed 2 nights at the Iroquois hotel before Christmas and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a great location, the staff are helpful and also happy to assist, the rooms are very comfortable and extremely clean with all the mod cons. However like all New York hotel rooms they are small. 
If you want a good night sleep, in a lovely New York hotel with exceptional service, I would recommend staying at the Iroquois Hotel. We will be back next time we're in NYC.
