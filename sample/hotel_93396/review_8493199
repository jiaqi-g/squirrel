My husband and i stayed at this hotel for a week for our honeymoon
We stayed in a one bedroom suite
which although pricey was extremely spacious and beautifully decorated
The complimentary molton brown toilettries
chocolates and bottle of wine were nice touches
The staff were all very friendly
also before our trip the consierge arranged tickets for the yankies game for us and the seats were fantastic
The location of the hotel was perfect
especially as it was our first time in New York
We would definately stay here again and would recommend to our friends and family
