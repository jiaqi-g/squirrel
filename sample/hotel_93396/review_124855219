My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend on the 2nd February
We normally stay at the Sofitel next door for our New York jaunts but fancied a change (and the Iroquois was a little bit cheaper)
The hotel has a fantastic location for tourists like ourselves
just a few minutes walk from Times Square and fifth avenue and with easy access to the Metro
The rooms are extremely well maintained and very well appointed
but are a little on the small side
This in no way affected our stay as there was still ample room for the 2 of us and the time we spent at the hotel and is really the only minor point I can think of
(Well that and I couldn't get the iPod dock in the room to work
but that's probably just me
)
The staff were extremely friendly and professional and we both enjoyed the free coffee served in the foyer during the mornings and hot cider served in the afternoons
I would have no qualms in recommending this hotel to friends and family (unless they needed loads of room) and would have no hesitation in staying here again
