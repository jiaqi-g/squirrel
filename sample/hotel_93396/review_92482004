Everything about our pre
Christmas visit to the Iroquois was terrific
The resourceful bellman stopped traffic on W 44th Street so I could back up and use a nearby garage
saving a time
consuming trip around the block
The Concierge has great recommendations for lunch and dinner spots
Our room was decent size
clean and very well maintained
It faced a back alley with a tiny bit of heating system noise
but preferable to the street noise which can be annoying in any big city
We look forward to returning
