~My Background~
I am a world traveler who is a loyal customers in major hotels such as Hilton and Marriott and a frequent flier Medallion with Delta Air Lines
~The Service~
THE CONCIERGE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE
The female concierge had an attitude and raised her voice at me and my mother who was traveling with us
When we asked for tickets to a broadway she gave us a hard way to go and the most expensive tickets
When she consulted us with the price of the tickets after going out for the city she said that she already bought them for us and she needed to be paid immediately
I will never return to the Iroquois because of this
When we went to complain to the front desk and ask for the manager
The manager did not respond to any of our requests
The Check
In desk service was just okay
~The Hotel~
The hotel is located blocks from Time Square
~The Room~
We had a 2 bedroom suite
The living room had a pull
out bed and the two bedrooms had king beds
The bathrooms were small yet well appointed
The beds were extremely comfortable
Fine chocolates were placed in the room every night at turn down
Virtually our room took up the front of the hotel
~The Food~
I would come back to the restaurant Triomphe
The french cuisine was spectacular
~Overall~
The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel with HORRIBLE SERVICE
In my opinion service is what makes a hotel
A 5 star hotel with bad service could make it feel like a 2 star
I would not stay at this hotel again
