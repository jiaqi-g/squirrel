The Iroquois is a wonderful small hotel that makes its guests feel welcome, comfortable and pampered. It is idealy situated in mid-town Manhattan with easy access to Broadway theaters and the best NYC restaurants.
The room, while small, was comfortable and beautifully appointed with quality furnishings and amenities including a plasma TV and DVD player. My wife was particularly impressed by the quality of the bedding, bath towels and robe. Our room was an executive king at approximately $525 per night plus taxes.
The hotel discount at the large parking garage accross the street was appreciated. It cost $93 to park for 3 days. Not bad in an area where it can cost up to $60 to park for one night at the theater. Remember to have your parking receipt validated at the front desk.
The only imperfection in an otherwise perfect stay were the slow elevators. We would definitely stay there again and look forward to our next visit.
