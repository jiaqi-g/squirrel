i understand from what you wrote as my room carpet was worn and older
i requested a smoking room so i knew the room would be colder and in that area
the king size bed was amazing
loved the furnishing and attention to detail on most things
a special thanks to angelique and nick who helped me being alone
they did everything for me i needed
i had a couple of issues with cold coffee delivery when i needed it at 3 am
but overall
fantastic place
seriosly
ten minutes one way
30 rock
ten the other
broadway times square
the red flag next door round corner was brilliant for food with huge portions and good food at a great price
only needed to eat once a day
great pharmacy/store Duane Richards beside that which has EVERYTHING you need
i mean EVERYTHING
the sauna was nice after a long day of walking in the cold
i felt lile a million bucks whilst there
thanks Iroquis staff
