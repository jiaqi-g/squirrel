The Iroquois is one of those finds that you almost want to keep to yourself
but we couldn’t help ourselves: My husband and I came back from our trip to New York telling everyone
“We stayed at the most wonderful place
”
Just a few weeks ago
was scrolling through these reviews
wondering if they might be too good to be true
Believe me
this hotel is superb
I was attracted by the Frette linens and robes; my husband liked that a 24
hour fitness center was available
and that discounted parking was right across the street
The amenities are luxurious
the bed and bedding the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in
But it was the friendly
attentive service that made us feel so welcome and pampered
We were warmly greeted by every person we encountered
The front desk upgraded our room upon arrival
not knowing that we were celebrating our anniversary
When the manager discovered it was so
he sent wine and chocolates and a lovely greeting to our room
And he remembered us and the occasion for our visit at check
Those were very nice touches in addition to other details we appreciated
the chocolates and weather card at turn down; the complimentary coffee and the Times in the morning; having a CD player in the room
It all added up to a lovely
singular experience for us
Believe me
we’ll be back
