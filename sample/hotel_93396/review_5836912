My wife and I spent five days at the Iroquois
Check
in went fine
However
when we arrived at our room
we noticed the shower window was see through
It was missing a film covering which prevents seeing into the shower
They moved us to another room on a lower floor (4th)
Noise was a major problem throughout our stay
The a/c did not keep the room cold
When we would call down
they would send someone up that would tell us the room felt cold to them
They told us they turned the a/c down from outside the room
It did not seem to make much of a difference
Each room does not have it's own a/c unit
It is from a central unit and you are not able to really control the a/c by the thermostat inside the room
The room itself was okay
small but nice
However
the bathroom was dirty
The shower was moldy and you could tell it had not been properly cleaned in quite some time
When the front desk rang our room to see how things were
I was unable to hear them as there was a problem with the phone
The phone did not work properly until the last day of our stay
At this point
we opted to clean the shower ourselves instead of complaining
The DVD player in the room quit working 1/2 way through a movie we were watching
Granted it might have been the DVD we borrowed from the front desk
but they did not even offer to check the player
We checked out the Sofitel next door after we were settled at the Iroquois
The rooms were much larger and the hotel is more luxurious
Unfortunately
they did not have any rooms available
We have stayed at other Small Luxury Hotels (Hotel Commonwealth
Boston
which was wonderful) and while this hotel is small it is certainly not luxurious
We would definitely not recommend this hotel
