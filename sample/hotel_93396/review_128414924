Me and my girlfriend stayed here in January
it was quite frankly one of the best decisions I have ever made
The hotel itself is literally a two min walk from times square
The hotel staff were both polite and helpful and we always felt welcome
The decor was beutiful with hot cider being served in a decanter downstairs at night
with access to newspapers/computers etc
really can't think of much to flaw this hotel
The room was a good size and the bathroom was always clean
Even the outside of the hotel was nice
with a polite doorman and easy access to transport/nyc cabs
All in all
this was the perfect base for us to explore NYC in style and comfort
at a good price too
Would definately visit again
