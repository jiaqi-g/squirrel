Tried the Iroquois Hotel after deciding that prices at the Waldorf had become too prohibitive and did not regret it
A small
charming
European style boutique hotel with smaller rooms but what it lacks in size
it more than makes up for in decor
Elegant furnishings
a super comfortable bed and lovely bathroom
Great location near Times Square but far enough to be away from noise and crowds and very near Bryant Park and Fifth Avenue
Staff was charming and helpful and they always had cold water available in the lobby which was great for warm days
Lots of fine restaurants nearby like the Daniel Boulod bistro almost next door
