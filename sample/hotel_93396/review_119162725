From the moment I walked up the steps to the front door and the very friendly doorman opened the door
till the moment I left for the airport
everything about my stay at the Iroqois was top notch
The staff was wecoming and helpful
I had a problem with my inroom telephone
and it was dealt with immediately
the staff in the restaurant was terrific
as was the food
The price was very affordable
the room is clean and comfortable
the bathroom is big
the linens and robes are Frette
the shower had water pressure
all those little things combined with the wonderful staff make it the hotel I will always stay in when in New York
