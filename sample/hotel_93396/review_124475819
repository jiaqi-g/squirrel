My husband and I stayed here for NYE 2012
It was kind of a last minute trip and I was looking for a four star hotel close enough to Times Square and still available two weeks before NYE
I read some great reviews on Trip Advisor of the Iroquois and we decided to stay here
The room was clean
but extremely small
even by NYC standards
but I think we had the smallest room on our floor when looking at the evacuation routes and floor plan posted to our door
I had requested a king sized bed and a room facing the street
and while I was advised those requests would be considered
neither was fulfilled
The room was clean
but the queen bed was small
both mine and my husbands' feet dangled off the edge
Since we only stayed the weekend
it wasn't that big of a deal
but if our trip was longer it would have become a problem
They served complimentary hot apple cider every afternoon in the lobby
which was delicious
It is a small
boutique hotel
but reasonably priced in an amazing location
we did not have to cab or take the subway our whole weekend and we went to Central Park
Times Square
Broadway
5th Avenue
Rockefellar Center and the Meat Packing District
I would consider it again for a weekend stay
