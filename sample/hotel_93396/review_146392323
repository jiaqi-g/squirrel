My husband and I stayed for the long weekend after Thanksgiving
This was our first stay at the Iroquois Hotel
We loved it
The staff was friendly and the room was as described
It was one of the cleanest rooms we have ever stayed at
The bathroom was updated and wonderful
We received a free breakfast with our reservation
It was GREAT
The orange juice was fresh squeezed and delicious
The basket of pastries were fresh and the fruit was freshly cut
Our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed
We would surely stay here again
