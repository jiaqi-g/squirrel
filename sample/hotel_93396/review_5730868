I stayed at the Iroquois on a business trip
It was in a great central location right off 5th Ave
in midtown
near shops
theaters
restaurants and a quick walk to Grand Central Station
Yet it was not too near super noisy Times Square
The service here was very good
It was on our corporate preferred list of hotels and since these can be hit or miss; I looked it up on Trip Advisor before I booked it
Since the reviews were good I decided it was worth a try
The service at the front desk
the restaurant
and the bell desk was excellent
I was upgraded on check
in and the room was quite comfortable
There was a flat panel TV
a very comfortable bed
a complimentary 1/2 bottle of wine
bottle of Perrier
and a small box of chocolates
There were terry robes in this room and the towels were nice and fluffy
I had some problems with the wireless internet
but was told they have signal boosters available
The room was a typically small NY hotel room
but it did have a desk
There was also a small fitness room at this hotel
I have already recommended it to friends and I plan to stay there on my next trip to New York
