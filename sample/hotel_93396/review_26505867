My daughter
age 23
and I visited New York for the first time and chose to stay at the Iroquois
I am so thankful we did
The hotel and staff are amazing
Courteous
informative and very caring
The hotel is a beautifully updated boutique hotel
The rooms were a little small but from what I understand they are large by New York standards
The beds were ultra plush with European linens
The hotel offers a complimentary turn
down service each evening
plus chocolates
During our stay
my daughter became extremely ill and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance
The staff at the Iroquois was extremely caring and helpful
We felt safe and well cared for the entire time we were at the Iroquois
The location is amazing
2 blocks to the center of Time Square and 2 blocks to Grand Central Station
I recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a convenient
clean
luxurious and reasonably priced hotel in New York City
