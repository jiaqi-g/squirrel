The hotel is located about a 5 min walk from Times Square and within easy walking distance of all the main attractions and the subway. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the neighbouring streets and the hotel's own restaurant is superb. 
We arrived around 2pm but check in was not available until 3pm. We were able to leave our bags so we had a walk around the local area and returned about 3.30pm. The front desk staff apologised for our room not being available early and check in was quick. Our bags were taken up by the porter Bill who was helpful and friendly and gave us a quick tour of the room and possible places to eat for dinner. 
The room is a little small but having read reviews of rooms in New York generally, I was pleasantly suprised at the amount of space. The room is certainly akin to an average room in the UK and the bathroom was spacious. Molten Brown toiletries were provided with plenty of good quality towels and bathrobes. The room was spotlessly clean. 
Our room overlooked 44th Street and we were not troubled with street noise. The bed was very comfortable and the room had all the amenities you could want. Only thing missing was coffee making facilities but there was free coffee in the lobby and a coffee shop right across the street. The minibar in the room is huge and very expensive! 
Check out was 12noon but we were able to leave our bags and return to the hotel for our taxi pick up at 3.30pm. 
The staff were at all times friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I could not fault the hotel. We managed to get a good deal direct with the hotel via their website. Would definitely stay again when in New York.
