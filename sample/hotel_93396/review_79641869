I have stayed in this hotel on two occasions, firstly with friends and the second time with my partner. Firstly the location of this hotel is excellent, just a short walk from times square and with many very nice restaurants in the area.
The rooms by new york standards are of moderate size, view from the rooms is really dependent on the type of room you book. The beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms have great showers and were spotless on both occasions.
The only thing that we found disappointing on both occasions was the hotel bar, perhaps we were just unlucky but on two occasions it did seem that we were intruding on the staff having a catch up and as it was uncomfortable for us to be there we left to go to another bar nearby.
Overall this hotel is very well located with very nice confortable rooms and polite staff. It may be worthwhile joining their members club as you do get extra perks with this.
