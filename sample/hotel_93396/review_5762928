My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 nights at The Iroquois New York Hotel in May and we were delighted with the accomodations and friendly
helpful front desk staff
The location is ideal; close proximity to Theatre District and Central Station
There is a very good and inexpensive restaurant next door for breakfast
It is very clean
exceptionally comfortable beds and all amenities are included
Daily newspaper
bottled water
We had a room with two double beds
down comforter
Egyptian cotton sheets
It is a small boutique hotel so expect the room and closet to be on the smaller scale
Highly recommend
