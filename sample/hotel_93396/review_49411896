My boyfriend and I stayed at the Iroquois for Labor Day weekend
which was also my birthday
The hotel has charm and character
When we arrived
the clerk informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite
It was gorgeous and bigger than most new york apartments
The staff could not be nicer and constantly anticipated our needs
The concierge's meal recommendations were spot on and the hotel's location was ideal
I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back
