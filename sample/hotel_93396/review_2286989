I had an enjoyable 2
night stay at the Iroquois
The room was beautifully appointed and included many creature comforts
Like the extra soft linens
luxurious terry robe
Belgian chocolates
CD player
cable TV including HBO
free high speed internet and NY Times
The lively central location was so accessible to everything New York
that I walked everywhere
at all hours
The lovely new marble bathroom and hot shower was always a welcome nearby respite
As well as a hotel laptop and printer that was available in the hotel library
I repeatedly used it for quick email or tourist info
