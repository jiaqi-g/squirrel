Took my mother to NYC for a few days
For the price of a room we got a suite which was charming
It was not large but we had privacy and the pull out couch had a memory foam mattress which was very comfortable
KIng bed looked great
but I let my mom use it so I can't testify to it's comfort
The rooms while small were very nicely furnished and we had both a great shower and a jacuzzi tub in our bathroom
There were 2 TVs
which we did not really have time to watch
We were 2 blocks from Time Square
and a block from 5th and yet the street is quiet
There's both upscale restaurants and bars on the block and a coffee shop and diner
We did not eat at the hotel's restaurant
so I can't comment on the food
but the bar was jumping
Not only would I stay here again
I will be disappointed if I can't get a good price and thus stay elsewhere
This was a really nice place and we got a very good deal
