A trip to New York was my birthday present and this hotel was very a great choice for a city trip
The staff was very friendly and helped out with questions when they could (especially Nick the Congierge was a big help)
The room was clean and tidy
not too big but then we didnt plan to stay in the room much except to sleep
We had booked the standard room with 2 double beds which is also suitable for couple (just use one bed as it's big enough for English standards)
All facilities were working
and turn down service (with chocolate
) was much appreciated
The location is superb
between 5th and 6th avenue and close to Times Square
Extremely touristic but with good access to all sightseeing points
There is a restaurant next door but it was a little noisy and you needed a reservation so we did not eat here
The bar is nice though but closed on Sundays
There is a business centre where you can use the internet for free (they have 2 computers) and wi
fi in the room is also available at no charge
There is also a fitness centre but I didnt try this so I cant comment on that
We had room 408 on the very end
and the view was awful but then the building is in the middle of the street so unless you're on the top floor
the view would have been of other buildings anyway
The only thing that was a little annoying was that there was some sort of fan or airconditioning outside the window (not sure if this belonged to the hotel or the adjacent building) which was a little noisy at night
Nothing that was majorly disturbing but the bathroom was quieter than the bedroom at times
The room was a little pricey but as I booked through booking
com it was still acceptable for a room in Manhattan at that location
All in all I am very pleased I chose this hotel and would definitely come again
