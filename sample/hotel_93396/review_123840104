We visit NYC often and have sometimes paid more for much less. The Iroquois is centrally located but at arm's length from the congestion and noise of Times Square. Although the rooms are small (especially if you choose two double beds, as we did), they and the public spaces are beautifully appointed and maintained. The staff is both personable and professional, and the property includes an excellent small restaurant,Triomphe, and a separate bar, Lantern's Keep, with an inventive list of cocktails. We usually are skeptical of hotel restaurants and bars, but we would definitely re-visit both. The price for our five-night stay averaged just over $200 per night, including taxes and fees--a bargain for this level of quality. We have only two small quibbles--a scorching 1600-watt hairdryer with limited settings and mattress covers that don't breathe--but these minor inconveniences would certainly not keeping us from re-visiting.
