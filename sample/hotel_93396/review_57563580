From the moment we arrived until the moment we left
our experience was wonderful
Everyone from the bellhops to the front desk to waitresses and the concierge were helpful and friendly
The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable; probably the most comfortable bed we have encountered in a hotel
No complaints at all
Would love to go back
