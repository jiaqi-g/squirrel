The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel
I chose it because of it's location to Times Square & 5th Avenue and because it also got good reviews here
The staff were very professional and always had a smile
The room was clean and cozy
Our suite
#1000
had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre
the windows open nice and wide
which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air
which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night
Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs
If you are a light sleeper
BRING earplugs to New York
My husband thought the room was a little small but I thought it was just right
When your on a quick 4 day'er
you don't spend any time in it anyway
It had a TV
dresser draws
a little fridge
a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair
Pretty standard
Unfortunately
we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great
Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite
so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip
There is a good
reasonably priced
family style restaurant at the end of the block called "the red flame"
Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price
As I mentioned
the hotel is close to everything
Don't kid yourself though
if you are in New York to see the sights
you will be walking alot
Bring good shoes
The hotel conceirge was fabulous when it came to giving us directions
especially subway lines
so don't worry about having to navigate it all by yourself
Thumbs up Iroquois
we will be back
