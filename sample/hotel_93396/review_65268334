The Iroquois was the perfect "home away from home" for my teenage daughter and I
The service was impeccible by all the staff
especially the DoorMan Bill
everyone was so helpful and friendly
very cozy library off main lobby with free internet
The room was very clean with comfy beds and crisp linens
fluffy towels and spa items
large flat screen TV and DVD (free movies from the front desk
ice delivery and free sparkling water daily
the turn down service included chocolates on our pillows
Super location 5 minute walk to Time Square
5th Avenue shopping and Grand Central Station
