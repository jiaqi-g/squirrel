I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels near Times Square and finally chose The Iroquois, which I booked on-line. Although the room were smaller than I am used to, it was, nonetheless, elegant and comfortable. What made The Iroquois so special was the staff. From Bill, the concierge to Ann in the bar and everyone in between....The entire staff was friendly, helpful and genuinely courteous. I was very happy with my experience there and would recommend it to anyone who wishes to be treated like their stay is appreciated.
