I have been to many luxury hotels around the world and the Iroquois NY is one of the best!
I stayed there 5 nights in February 2010.
It's very well located between Time square, 5th avenue luxury shops, a few blocks from Rockefeller center and Empire states building. 
The staff was really nice and helpful, I had a deluxe room when I arrived at the hotel I asked for a room with Chrysler building view, none was clean or available so Sharon one of the front desk lady made everything for me to have one. 
I had it rather quickly and the short waiting really worth it! I had a superb Chrysler building view for me the most beautiful in NYC especially at night.
I was on the 10th floor. The room was well equipped with 32" flat screen TV (about 50 channels), radio with iPod dock, desk, two phones, a safe, FREE Wifi, marble bathroom and a very comfortable bed.
I have really appreciated the complimentary nightly turndown service with Belgium chocolates and weather card, the coffee in the morning and tea in the evening that you can drink in the lobby for free or reading your mails on the computers of the small library.
The concierge was also really helpful giving me good advices about Broadway shows.
The bar of the hotel has a great choice of alcohol and good cocktail card.
The restaurant offered good French and Italian inspired cuisine.
It's probably one of the best hotel of NYC by its situation and its quality of service. A great value for the price!!
