When staying in the Times Square area, we usually stay at one of our favorite hotels down the block and always wanted to try The Iroquois Hotel. I'm so glad we did. The staff is professional and polite. Upon checking in we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite. I like booking rooms with separate seating area, so I had originally booked a smaller suite. Well, I couldn't believe when we walked into this suite! It was absolutely wonderful! Living room, dining room, kitchen and bedroom. There was just one thing. The bathroom stall shower was tiny. But if you like to take a bath, it has jacuzzi. The decor is elegant and the bed very cozy. I don't sleep very well in hotel rooms, but I did in this bed. Until the morning when a jackhammer woke us up. They were opening up the street below the hotel. Even with the construction going on, we had a wonderful stay because the room was so nice.
