We stayed at the Iroquois in a deluxe room for one night in December
The staff were very friendly and seemed to work together as a unit
The room and bathroom were clean
coffee and cider were available in the lobby
and there were free dvds for loan at the front desk
I enjoy this hotel's location
right next door to the Algonquin
I find it to be very convenient
Although it is very close to Times Square
the street upon which it is located is fairly quiet and feels old
timey in its own way
It was a comfortable stay
