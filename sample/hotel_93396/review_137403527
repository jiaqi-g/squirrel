We stayed for 10 nights recently and booked after reading positive reviews on Trip Advisor. We Had requested a room with a view if possible and they upgraded us to a room on the 10th floor with a bay window that looked out towards the Chrysler Building. 
The hotel is elegantly old fashioned, and for a hotel a block away from Times Square it is very quiet. You can't hear much noise from the street (with the exception of the odd garbage truck or siren which you would hear anywhere in NY). 
The rooms are not large but then most hotel rooms in NY are not big. However being so close to Times Square and several subway stations was great. You can walk to many attractions such as the Rockerfeller Centre and USS Intrepid. 
The wi fi was always reliable and there is a computer in the library off the lobby that you can use if you need to print.
All the staff were great, particularly Patrick who always greeted us warmly. 
We would certainly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting something quiet but close to Times Square.
