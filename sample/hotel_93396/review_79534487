Would have no hesitation in using this hotel again
All staff were very courteous
helpful and professional
Room although slightly on the small side was clean
comfortable
flat screen TV and bathroom had quality Molton Brown toiletries
Turn down service and chocolates were nice each evening
Bed was extremely comfortable and didn't notice any noise at night at all
Location was excellent for 5th Avenue shopping and Times Square
All in all was very satisfied with the Iroquios and would stay there again when visiting the city
