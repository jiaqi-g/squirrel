Stayed at the hotel 2 nights. - very quiet, very clean, small room -but very comfortable ( didn't come to spend time in the room), very helpful staff - I read many reviews before making a decision on where to stay - it came well recommended and it did not disappoint. Be sure to put this charming small luxury hotel on your list of places to stay in NYC.
