We stayed here recently at the end of our trip to the USA. The hotel has a great location just a short walk from Times Square, The Rockefeller Centre and 5th Avenue. The rooms were smallish but this is to be expected in NYC. Having said that the rooms were very comfortable and clean. the hotel is an older building and so this gave it more character and the staff could not do enogh to help us in our stay. They really made us feel that we were in a home away from home
