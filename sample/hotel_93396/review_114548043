My husband and I just spend the weekend at the Iroquois Hotel In New York and had a wonderful time
This hotel is really nice
The front desk staff was very friendly
the doorman was always willing to help you
Our room was very nice
cleaned each day and turn down service at night with chocolates on the bed
What a nice touch
This hotel is at a great location
Only a few blocks from Time Square but far enough that it is quiet
We had no problem sleeping at night
We heard no noice from the outside at all
I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to New York City and looking for a ncie small hotel with great service
We would come back here again anytime
