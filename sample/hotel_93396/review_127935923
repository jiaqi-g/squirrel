This was my third time staying at is hotel...and again it didn't disappoint. Great location...can easily walk to broadway, times square, rockefeller center..etc. Vanessa the concierge is the best part of this hotel...she knows everyone by name, all their preferences and never steered us wrong. The car service they set up for us was on time, professional and very friendly. I would recommend splurging for the deluxe room...you get significantly more space...especially in the bathroom. Very comfortable beds wi nightly turn down service and chocolates. Everyone from the doormen to the reception staff a super friendly. There is one woman with strawberry blonde hair who is a bit cold and unfriendly but we just waited until someone else was up there to ask questions. I have stayed here previously and the elevator took forever...they seemed to really improve this and it was noticeably better this time. Our flight arrived around noon and they had a room ready for us immediately. Would absolutely go back.
