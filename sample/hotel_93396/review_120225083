The hotel is in a great location only a few blocks from Times Square
Rockefeller Center and St
Patrick's Cathedral
the room was clean
well appointed and there were nice little touches here and there to make our stay more pleasurable
The service was absolutely top notch
They couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating
The hotel staff from our experience curbside
at the front desk and with housekeeping was outstanding
Everyone was friendly and so willing to be of assistance in any way
We've stayed in other NYC hotels and never had such a warm and welcoming experience at another hotel
let alone a hotel in NYC
People who say New Yorkers aren't nice or hospitable
never stayed at the Iroquois
The concierge's choice of restaurant was great
Our experience overall was A++++++++++++
We will definitely recommend this hotel to our friends and are already looking forward to returning
