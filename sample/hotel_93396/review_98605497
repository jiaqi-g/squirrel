My friend and I recentely stayed for two nights at the Iroquios in New York
As we only had two nights we wanted to stay somewhere central to midtown
The Iroquois was perfect
only 1 1/2 blocks from time square in one direction and two blocks from central station in the other direction
Our room was spotless
It was a room with two very comfortable double beds
and although a little cosy
it was comfortable
The was no view to speak of but that didn't bother us as we were out most of the time exploring New York
Vanessa the consierge was very helpful
I had contacted her before we arrived and got help to buy discunted theatre tickets thanks to a code she gave me
which turned out to be fantastic seats
she also help us choose a lovely restaurant for dinner before the show
which was very good value
Overall staying at the Iroquios was a great choice and would recommend it to anyone who wants to be that end of Manhatten
