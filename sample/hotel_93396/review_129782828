Our second stay at this ideally located hotel
The rooms are a good size (for NewYork)
clean
quiet (we faced 44th)
The staff are very helpful
Sergio
a concierge
was of great assistance; arranged transportation
restaurants
next visit we'll give him some notice and have him secure tickets to shows and our pickup at the airport
Most of our meals we ate
out but the dinner in the hotel was good; chef Jason came by with his personal touch
Morning coffee was available but perhaps an all day coffee / tea bar in the library might be appreciated
Only one elevator was in service while we were there but we weren't in a rush
One in our party checked before hand
bedbug registry
Iroquois
justifiably has a clean bill
Our group decided that NY will be an annual event and The Iroquois will continue to be our NY base
