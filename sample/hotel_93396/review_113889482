Excellent experience. Needed an NYC overnight for a Saturday evening show. Selected the Iroquois based on a combination of cost (relatively less than other hotels in general area), location, and user reviews (generally very favorable). Our small, corner room was very comfortable with hints of luxury (bathrobes, elegant bathroom fixtures). Probably not a good choice for breathtaking views of the city (our view was of the side of the adjacent building; we kept the blinds drawn). 
Very friendly, helpful staff. 
Parking ($40 / day) is across the street (on the right side of 44th St.), and actually a couple doors before you get to the entrance for the hotel (on the left side). The 44th St. location makes for a convenient walk to the theatres; for us, this was a 9-block walk that is much easier than it might sound.
Only two minor hiccups: 
Since the reservation desk handles the Iroquois and the Chandler hotels, my reservation was initially inadvertently saved for the Chandler Hotel (and I noticed this from the confirmation e-mail). Another clerk readily fixed the snafu during my follow-up phone call. Second was the min-bar/fridge; items there are automatically charged to the room if you remove them for something like 15 seconds, whether or not you put them back. Fortunately, when I explained my mistake to the woman at the front desk, she ensured I was not charged for these. 
Would definitely stay there again!
