My boyfriend and I came to New York in September from Maui (the mecca for lavish holidays) and looked and looked for a decently priced place to stay. While this was at the top of our range, it was so worth it. The hotel is upscale, classy and decorated with classic furnishings. The staff was incredibly attentive from the beginning, from the doorway to the rooms. Our second night we had an unexpected visitor from out of town and we asked for a roll-away bed in our room. Instead, they upgraded us to the James Dean Suite and promptly had our luggage delivered. Bill, the bellman, was very sweet and helpful, offering wonderful local knowledge about restaurants, hot spots and personal memories of growing up in New York. Caroline, one of the front desk attendants, promptly helped us with our many needs in a polite and efficient manner. I called downstairs to get band-aids (because I had to wear my pretty shoes - I was in NYC!) and they were at the door before we could even wonder when they were coming. In a nutshell, this is a wonderful hotel, very worth the price. The rooms are very clean, very comfortable (most of the rooms have been retro-fitted to be noise-proof to help with NYC street noise), and the staff was just wonderful. We would highly recommend this hotel to any dear friends and family. Its a perfect location for hitting all the tourist spots in midtown. Cheers to the Iroquois!
With much aloha!, Sarah and Timothy
