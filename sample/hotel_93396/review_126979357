The entrance hall is not a good start as it reminds you of something rather old and cheap
The staff were all very nice and helpful
The deluxe room was OK
the bed was large and comfortable
and the bathroom was attractive and clean
but the room felt a little dark and dated and the view to the back was not great
The hotel has a very popular small cocktail bar at the rear
which whilst not attractive when empty certainly livens up
Well placed if you want to be near the theatre district
The included breakfast is limited and does not change
