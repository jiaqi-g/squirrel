Just returned from our long weekend in NYC. We booked our trip through American Express Travel and decided on The Iroquois based on the reviews and ratings on TripAdvisor. The combo room and airfare rates were better than booking through any other source I found, though they do seem to change daily - so, plan ahead and book 4-5 weeks in advance for the best deals.
This hotel was renovated in 2006 and is currently undergoing a update to the lobby area. It is conveniently located on 44th just a couple of blocks from everything in mid-town. Closest subway station is a short walk to Bryant Park. Very convenient for our trip to Yankee Stadium!
Our 6th floor room was quiet (which is amazing for NYC) and somewhat small, but typical-sized for boutique hotels. The bath was very well appointed and bed very comfortable, too.
The staff was friendly and very helpful on recommendations, directions, etc. Couldn't ask for more!
Highly recommend The Iroquois for your next stay in Manhattan.
