My husband and I enjoyed a long overdue weekend away in NYC in early fall 2009
We found the Iroquois to be a romantic
elegant
convenient hotel with excellent service and a fabulous concierge
The Iroquois' concierge
was knowledgeable and resourceful with impeccable taste
without seeming pretentious
When we found ourselves without dinner reservations for Saturday night
Nick asked a few questions about our tastes (we're foodies) and the type of night we were looking to have (romantic) and quickly recommended Oceana on 49th & 6th
Nick confirmed a reservation for us on the spot and had a reminder card with restaurant details sent to our room
Oceana was the perfect choice for us (separate review under Restaurants to come)
With Nick's help
we had a wonderful dining experience
I would highly recommend the Iroquois for a weekend getaway
and may you be fortunate to find Nick at the helm during your visit
