We really enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois. This was our first stay in a Manhattan hotel and we were looking for a smaller non-chain hotel to get a real experience of New York. This hotel was just as we expected with no unpleasent surprises. We never felt crowded and the staff was very helpful and courteous. We stayed on the 11th floor. Our deluxe room had a king bed that was plush comfort. The bathroom was exquisite with the smooth marble tile throughout. The water pressure and temperature of the shower were excellant and there were oatmeal soaps that we both liked. The robes were a nice thick heavy cotton that made a nice finish to your shower. The minibar was clearly marked with terms and prices. They had a computer near the lobby that we could use to look things up, and they stored our luggage after check out when we had a couple of hours to kill. This building like others of its age has a central air conditioning unit. Our only complaint we could have would be the room temperature was difficult to control, but it was never really uncomfortable. Another big plus is this hotel is centrally located so you can walk to Grand Central Station, Times Square, theaters and tour buses. It is a nice part of the apple.
