My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois New York for the 2nd time the weekend of November 19, 2011. When we arrived, a room with a view that I had requested was not available, and as such Conny who checked us in offered us a free upgrade to a suite! We were celebrating my birthday so this was especially a great surprise! The suite was absolutely perfect! We also felt the rest of the staff was very friendly and enjoyed some nice conversations with Thomas when coming & going to the hotel. It was especially nice that they remembered us as we walked up and got closer to the hotel door. This was our second stay at this hotel and we cannot recommend it highly enough. The wonderful Molton Brown amenities in the bathroom were luxurious and a nice treat. The bed is extremely comfortable as well. We love the location of this hotel - it's a short walk to Times Square and the theater district. We cannot wait until our next trip to stay at the Iroquois New York!
