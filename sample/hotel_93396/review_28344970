I booked this hotel on the internet and did'nt have any references but the pictures and description
I have been in New York before and got disappointed
when I arrived at the hotel
But The Iroquois was perfect in many ways
Not very expensive but cozy
clean and so service minded
The front desk employees were so kind and helpfull
and every day we got a free paper
chocolate
sparkling water and the weather forecast on our room
So I will recommend this place
to everybody
