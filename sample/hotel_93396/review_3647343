I went to the Iroquois with anticipation since it had a very appealing website and was touting itself as a luxury hotel and was unpleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was extremely short-staffed, resulting in a situation where one's requests were handled rudely. The room I stayed in, billed as an executive king room, was very small, very dimly lit and depressing. They claim to have 24 hour room service which they dont. They do not have a telephone operator or direct access to the services, everything being routed to the front desk, which could not really process these requests being tied down to answering phones all day.
All in all I found the Iroquois a ghastly experience
