We enjoyed The Iroquois as our platform for a wedding weekend in New York. 
Over the four days, we had events throughout town .... Central Park West, Upper East Side, a gathering and run in Central Park, The Boathouse, Battery Park Gardens, and there in Mid-Town at The Century. With one suite and four additional rooms for a total of 17 room-nights, we had special needs in setting up, cars to and from, extra towels, and TLC. Quiet and convenient.
Every member of The Iroguois staff rose to the occasion, was thoroughly warm, accommodating, and thorough. Enjoy!
