Me and my friend stayed in The Iroquois from 17th April
22nd April fro 5 nights
I original was looking to stop at the Sofitel but it was alittle more expensive but had simlare reviews to the Iroquois
Upon arrive I found that the Iroquois is next door but one to the Sofitel
The rooms are very clean and spacious with flat screen tv (perfect pictures aswell)
hair dryer
ironing board etc all you need from a hotel
I loved the added benefit of Molton Brown toilities in the bathroom
If I had know I would not have brought my own shampoo
The beds were very comfortable but the pillows were alittle too big for my liking
The only down side I experienced was the concierge was not the best but I didn't realy need her as it was my second visit to NY
but the recptionist were just as helpfull when I asked them any advice and recommending restaurants etc
The location is fantastic
right between times square and 5th avenue
this is perfect location for any tourist
Every moning we walked down to The Red Flame dinner just down the street who have a fantastic breakfast menu and the quickest serving waitresses I have ever experienced
Breakfast is in front of you within 4 minutes of ordering (yes I timed them)
Overall I would definatly stop in this hotel again when I return in a few years or so
I spent hours reseaching hotels for my trip and I would just say to anybody doing the same
same your time and go with the Iroquois
