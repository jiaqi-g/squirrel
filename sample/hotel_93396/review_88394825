This is a dignified older property on "Club Row"
and enough has been written about its good features
We liked its ideal location
refreshing non
trendiness
and reasonably
sized queen room
But what I want to praise is the staff
When we got into our room (on November 21)
we found it too hot for us
and called the front desk
Eva explained that the HVAC system is somewhat antiquated and does not allow for individual room thermostat control on our particular floor
She offered to see what engineering could do
and when that wasn't enough
she personally escorted us on a tour of two other available rooms
and even helped us move to one of them
before we finally decided to go back to our original room (we're not usually so difficult)
The room cooled down a bit and was just fine
the morning we were supposed to check out we woke up sick and unable to travel
and Eva was again very helpful in extending our stay and brought us up some hot herb tea
The housekeeper that morning (November 23
Room 605) was also very kind and solicitous
she quickly did what needed to be done for our room and made sure we had all necessary supplies
We felt better the next morning
and were efficiently checked out and put in a cab
We like this part of town and this kind of property (small
quiet
understated)
and appreciate the kindnesses extended to us
