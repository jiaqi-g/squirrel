Stayed here for one night July 5th
The Iroquois is a lovely small hotel
gorgeous atmosphere
with the most attentive staff I have ever experienced in any hotel
I highly recommend it to anyone wishing to stay in the Midtown area
as the hotel is literally within sight of Times Square and a short walk to Rockefeller Center
