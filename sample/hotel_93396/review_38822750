We love it here. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in NYC. Well appointed (though small) rooms. Lot's of extra touches, turndown service, New York times daily, chocolates at night, fresh iced herbal tea in the looby, quaint library with internet service and printer. You can walk to everything! and the beds are to die for.
Tip: The Red Flame diner near by is a great standard.
