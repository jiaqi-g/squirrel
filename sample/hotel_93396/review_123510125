We had the pleasure staying here this past weekend. It was our first time and we were delighted! The moment we walked in we were greeted and felt at home. The staff was friendly and accomodating to our needs. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The accomodations were top notch. The bed was so comfortable! The location is ideal and in walking distance of Time Square, Broadway and much more. Will definitely be returning to The Iroquois. Thank you for a wonderful weekend.
