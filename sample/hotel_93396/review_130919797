This is a very nice smaller hotel and is within walking distance to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and theatres etc. Our room was small but adequate. We didn't have a view but we didn't care as we didn't spend that much time in our room. The bed was very comfortable with nice bedding and the bathroom walls, shower and fixtures were all new. The onsite restaurant was not open while we were there as it was being remodeled. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful especially Sergio, the consierge and Rocky, the Bellman. We would definately stay here again.
