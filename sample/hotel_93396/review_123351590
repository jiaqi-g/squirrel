We stayed here August 2010
it was very warm in the city so the cool lobby and rooms were perfect
There were 4 of us in 2 rooms
we would have liked 4 seperate beds in one big room or even adjoining rooms but this never seems to be an option in new york
The rooms were comfortable and I got the best sleep I've EVER had
they use simmons mattresses with egyptian cotton sheets and pillow cases
nice and cool when you got into the sheets but kept you warm
an absolute delight
New York is famed for it's tiny rooms but high prices but these rooms were't too small
I had also requested a fridge in each room as I knew we'd want to keep stuff cold whilst there
Both rooms had a mini fridge and they worked fine and not noisy like some can be
Our rooms were also pretty quiet
no noisy neighbours luckily
Service was okay
nothing amazing but we never really asked for anything after the fridges
Our friends had a problem with their bedroom lock on the door but this was rectified within 30 minutes
The bar in the hotel (like most) was a little over priced but nice for a treat
Location was perfect
right in the heart of it all
a couple of doors down from an AMAZING Indian restaurant and 5th Avenue
There's also a handy deli across the street that serves cold beverages and it's open VERY late so very handy for evening snacks
salad
juice (and in our case chocolate and crisps
)
I would stay in the Iroquois again and have told others to stay there too
A loyalty card would be a good idea
