I stayed ONLY one night but my experience was wonderful
Every member of staff was charming and helpful
without exception
The room itself though a little small was well furnished with a very comfortable bed
and the bathroom products and towels as well as a Frette bathrobe were top quality
I have stayed in many central New York hotels but this hotel rated very very high and I would def return
Close to all amenities and a great coffee shop opposite
Free WiFi in the room and free internet in the lounge
coffee as well on tap in the reception
10 out of 10 Iroquois
