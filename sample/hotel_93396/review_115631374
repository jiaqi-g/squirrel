The Iroquois is a true gem right next to all the action of time square
We were within walking distance of most of the shows and lots of shopping
Places to eat were plentiful and all that we tried were excellent
The staff was very helpful
The rooms were clean
beds comfortable and bathroom was much larger than I expected
Looking forward to staying here in the future
