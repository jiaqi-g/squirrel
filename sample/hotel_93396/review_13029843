I moved to the Iroquois from another hotel where I was underwhelmed by the service. The Iroquois experience was like entering a different world by comparison. The reception was amazing and the staff are universally helpful, friendly, polite and willing, even eager, to deliver above and beyond the call.
The reception area is lovely, with a small "library" with comfortable seating and a computer and free Internet access. The entire hotel offers complimentary wireless Internet access which is a rarity even at luxury hotels like Four Seasons, which I think Iroquois outshines.
The hotel's restaurant, Triomphe is actually as good, in my limited experience, as is promised. Small but elegant and excellent food, nice bar, comfortably between formal elegant and "biz" casual.
Of all the Iroquois's virtues, however, it is the standard of service and care that I have found extraordinary. I have stayed in at least a dozen "luxury" hotels in New York from the Soho & Tribeca Grand's to Four Seasons and Ritz. Iroquois (certainly for the money) bests them all. Whoever is doing the hiring and training at Iroquois understands what true excellence in service is all about: making the guest feel like their concerns are paramount and that everything possible has been done to meet and exceed one's needs.
I come to New York to work often and I plan to make Iroquois my new home away from home. Hope to see you there!
