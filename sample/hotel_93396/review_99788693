This was my first trip back to the Iroquois for 10 years and I wasn't disappointed
The quality is still excellent and the staff could not be more helpful
We had a typical New York room
Not very big and certainly no view but everything else was spot on
The ipod player went down well in our room and in the room of my two grown up children
The concierge was more than helpful is giving advice and helping to arrange theater tickets and restaurants and also arrange for a complimentary fruit plate on my wife's birthday
The location is superb within 2 blocks of Time Square so most places are within easy reach on foot
taxi or subway
There are also some really good restaurant and bars nearby
If I am NY then I will definitely be back
