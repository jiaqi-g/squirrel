Right on Hotel Row on West 44th between 5th and 6th
The Iroquois allows a very easy walk to most Broadway houses
Rockefeller Center
Grand Central
5th Avenue shopping
Times Square
the New York Public Library
and a host of other touristy things
It's a hotel bar
hopper's dream as well
since the Mansfield
Sofitel
Royalton
and Algonquin are on the same block
(The Algonquin is closed for renovation until at least May 2012
) The Bryant Park/42nd street subway station is a two
minute walk away
which allows access to several lines
Grand Central is slightly farther
but also has several other subway lines
so it's very easy to use public transportation from this starting point
I went all over the City and only used a cab once
and that was because it was late at night
This is a small boutique hotel
so everything is compact and cozy
but they have done a remarkable job of keeping the character of this 1930's
era building while updating it for modern needs and expectations
The lobby is charming with marble floors
a chandelier
and dark walls
There's a small library facing the street with complimentary computer/printer access and a selection of newspapers
The lobby offers complimentary cider in the winter as well
Off to the right of the lobby is the restaurant Triomphe (which also provides the room service)
It has a small bar area in the front
then a cozy
small dining room
I only had breakfast here so I can't comment on any other menus
but it was fast
done precisely to order
and very efficiently served
To the back of the lobby is the cocktail salon
Lantern's Keep
It is
as they say
a "jewel box" of a room done in a Paris salon style
The juices are all fresh
squeezed and there is a terrific selection of house
created cocktails on the menu served by fantastic bartenders who will chat while they work even though they're busy without missing a beat
A stop here is a must if you stay at the Iroquois
though they aren't kidding when they suggest reservations
With only a couple of dozen seats
it can fill up very quickly and once here
you won't be inclined to leave for a while
The rooms are quite small
but space has been used efficiently
Tall leather headboards affixed to the wall give them a smart look and there is plenty of closet and drawer space
The beds are very comfortable
The mini
bar is a little pedestrian and it's one of those sensor
driven things
but at least the rooms are equipped with them
My bathroom seemed larger than those pictured on the website
The room was at the end of a hallway
so I thought perhaps the floor plan was a little different
Water temperature and pressure were great
which is a relief in an older building
Higher floors facing 44th St
have decent views of the block and some of the skyscrapers beyond
I requested one when I made my reservation and they took pains to ensure that at check
The rooms are equipped with DVD players and you will be provided with a password to the complimentary wi
fi when you check in
These extras are much
appreciated
For me
the true 5
star hotels in New York are high
luxury places like the St
Regis
the Mandarin Oriental
and the Four Seasons
As a boutique property
the Iroquois is not equipped to provide the same range of options and level of room size/quality
But they also don't have the pricetags of those hotels
and it's not their aim to be one of those guys
If you can score one of their frequent package or multiple
night discount deals online
then the combination of value
comfort
and location provided here make it one of the very top boutiques in the city
Side note: Also on the same block is the Greek restaurant Kellari
which has a sensational grilled octopus dish
