We stayed at the Iroquois in March of 2009
It was the perfect location for us
being close to Times Square but tucked away from the crowd
Our little window "view" was of the brick back side and the next building behind it but it was very quiet
The staff was accommodating and kind
Though we never did have "bathrobes and slippers" as was advertised
However
it was hardly necessary since we were out and about most of the day
not lounging around the room
The complimentary computer with internet (down in the library) came in handy for checking email and booking some last minute tickets for the Statue
The furnishings were very nice
love those sheets
and my bedtime chocolate left with the turn
down bed service
The room was small but the bathroom was good sized and nicely appointed
In the standard room that we had there is only the bed for a sitting area with the exception of a desk chair
But since we spent very little time in the room and had done a lot of walking
the bed was a welcome lounge chair
Flat screen tv was nice
NYTimes in the morning at your door
the little fridge would have been nicer had there been room to store a few of our own things vs
just the drinks you had to pay (a lot) for
We drank the "free" sparkling water left for us and bought drinks and snacks down at the local drugstore in Times Square to bring back to the hotel
My only disappointment was the cost of the breakfast for what I got
My husband fared better with his choice (the French Toast I think
but still a small amount for what you paid for)
If you are going to eat at their restaurant for breakfast
the food is good
but go for the "breakfast bar"
Don't go for the crepes
Far too drenched in syrup and nothing else with it
I think the berries had been frozen
I was not impressed
Not much to go on for the day
The coffee was good
A great little diner just down the street (on the way to Times Square) was very "New York" and had great All American food at a very reasonable price
Sorry I can't remember the name of it
One thing is for sure
there is plenty of food in NY
sure glad I was able to walk all over the city to burn off the calories
Overall
we enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel
We probably would not have been able to afford staying there without the good rate we had through our Entertainment Book
It was a bit of luxury that we do not often get to treat ourselves to
