I took a group of 14 ladies to New York for a four day shopping trip. I have done this same trip over the last eight years. This was our first time to stay at the Iroquois New York. The hotel is a wonderful place to stay. I worked with Lauren in group sales prior to our visit and she was so helpful with all the pre-departure arrangements. I also worked with Angelic both prior to and during our stay to arrange transportation, tickets etc. and she was so nice and helpful. The hotel is located well within walking distance to Times Square, Rockefellow Center, many theaters and restaurants and shopping. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the entire staff is amazing. I would definately recommend this hotel and I will definately stay there again.
