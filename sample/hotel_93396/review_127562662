My husband surprised me with an overnight stay in Manhattan at the lovely Iriquois! From the moment of our arrival we were greeted with warm smiles from the attentive staff. Everyone was accomodating and helpful. The check in was smooth and we were enjoying our beautful room in a matter of minutes. We stayed in a suite which was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom amenties were top of the line and the bed was literally the most comfortable bed we'd ever slept in. Our favorite part of the hotel is the amazing bar called the "lanterns keep". The bar serves up classic drinks made by hand. The barternders are supper helpful and treated us like special guests. We just cannot say enough about the hotel. Perfect location, welcoming staff and wonderful rooms. We highly recommend it!! it truly is the perfect romantic getaway!
