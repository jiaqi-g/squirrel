I stayed at this hotel with my mum from the 19th nov
22nd nov
From reading some of the reviews I was abit anxious however the hotel was superb
We had 2 double beds which were very comfy
The room size was small but cozy
The molten brown toiletries were re
stocked everyday
The location to all the main attractions were great
Bill was fantastic
Also the concierege were very knowledgable and gave us maps with directions to various locations
Also the day we left we were going to get a taxi to the airport but the lovely lady at the concierge suggested we walk 2 blocks and wait a max of 15 minutes and catch a shuttle bus
this cost 30 dollars for 2 us
instead of the 100 quoted by many taxi drivers
I feel that everyone i came into contact with went the extra mile
I would definately stay at this hotel again
