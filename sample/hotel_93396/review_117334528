Yes, the Iroquois is quaint, reasonably clean, centrally located, and cheaper than the Sofitel next door. But the lower floors have several rooms with large generators immediately outside if the windows. One of these generators was outside of my room on my first night in the hotel. At first, I thought it was just a noisy air conditioner but when I realised I could not stop the racket, I called the front desk who sent a maintenance guy upstairs. He informed me in that charming New York fashion, "It's the generator outside your window. There's nothing I can do. This is New York. It can be loud here. You got a loud room". When I protests that this was unacceptable, he referred me back to the front desk who assured me that I had a rare condition of sleep sensitivity and most people never had any such problem. I told the night clerk that this was clearly nonsense, especially as he could hear the generator OVER THE PHONE! Finally, at around 2:00 am, I was offered an alternative room. This was s special room designed for the handicapped which I was understandably, but again inconveniently forced to vacate the next day.
The ultimate outcome of all of this for me was that I was an utter zombie at my business meeting the next day for which I had flown to New York.
From now on, I'm paying the extra $100 per night to stay in the Sofitel next door.
