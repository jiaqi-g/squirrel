My husband and I have made a hobby of trying different hotels in NY. The Iroquios surpassed our expectations. We traveled to a two room suite on the 12th floor which was beautifully furnished, extremely quiet, great linens, soft robes and very clean. All the comforts of home! Two flat screens, pull out sofa and refrig. Staff we friendly and helpful. We would love to return.
