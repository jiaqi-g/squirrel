I stayed here for 3 days in December as a solo traveller
my trip was primarily shopping and site seeing
The Iroquois is a small luxury hotel which is privately owned conveniently located for Times Square and the shopping in 5th Avenue
I was impressed by the location between 5th and 6th Avenues since you don't feel like you are entering a bussling environment the moment you step out of the hotel
It is very close but has that classy distance so you feel like you are staying in NY but aren't actually in NY
The residents of the hotel tend to be well heeled and well dressed who have travelled to NY a few times before and would like to see Broadway Shows and stroll down 5th Avenue
There aren't that many jeans and sneakers residents
saying that it is not at all pretention but you can tell people sneaking a look at your shoes when they see you in the elevator
The hotel is a favourite for single travellers
especially female since it has a safe feel about it and thankfully no business travellers
Check
in for me was very smooth and the room although small was not small by NY standards
I took great pleasure in seeing the reassuring Molton Brown products which were generously replenished daily
There are robes and towels and interestingly a dvd player
you can get dvds from reception free of charge which is a nice touch
There was a little office table in my room and no problem with the free wireless
the free wireless was an important freebie for me
For those not bringing their own laptop there are two terminals in the downstairs library area
there was not a queue for the terminals and owing to the class of people here they were just on and off the machines
Beds were comfortable
no problem sleeping
The reception area has free coffee till about 10am and then hot apple cider which was wonderful
I didn't personally use the restaurant here but I suspect it was good quality
Staff are very friendly but give you your space and are always willing to look into for example opening hours for a shop for you
There is also a dedicated concierge
For me this place was perfect
had I been travelling on business I may have preferred a place like the London NYC for the simple fact that it has an impressive entrance and obvious space for coffee and meetings
However
this is a different animal completely and caters for people who are not travelling with an expenses budget
As for issues
the only issue I can see is only having 2 elevators
not a problem if you are on the lower floors since there is a staircase and I can't say this proved an problem for me
Overall I would recommend this hotel to you should you wish to spend a few days in a charming little hotel
