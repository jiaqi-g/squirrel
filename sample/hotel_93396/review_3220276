I stayed at the Iroquois while I was in NYC on business about 3 weeks ago (late January '05). Everything was perfect. The rooms are small but perfect for one person traveling alone on business. (Reminder: 99% of hotels in NYC have very small rooms.) My flight arrived at 8:30 AM so I was at the hotel shortly by 9:30 AM and just wanted to check my bag with them but they had a room ready for me so I was able to freshen up before my meetings. I had a room on the 6th floor (600) that faced a little courtyard which was quite nice as the hotel is not tall. About 10 minutes after arriving, they called the room to make sure that everything was satisfactory. The bed was amazing, like sleeping on a giant pillow. Wonderul linens and down pillows with big duvet. The bathroom was great with Molten Brown toiletries and a showerhead with unbelieveable water pressure. I was concerned about the handle on the shower because it felt like it was loose so I told them at the front desk when I left to go to dinner around 7 PM, when I returned 3 hours later it had been fixed. The room had a COMPLIMENTARY liter bottle of SmartWater on the desk when I arrived! Nobody offers free anything anymore. The hotel also had complimentary overnight shoeshine service which was quite nice. The Iroqois offers a nice [big] continetal breakfast in your room for $11.95, a steal in NYC. I was on business and paid $260 per night, including tax. That is a steal for 4-stars in midtown during the week. I booked directly from their website, not through a broker. Trust me, you always get treated better when you book directly. This was a superior New York hotel experience!
