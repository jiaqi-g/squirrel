We actually loved the Iroquois
night staff was lovely
Our room
a deluxe was great with a gigantic window
My problem was with the room service and Sunday am staff
There is no breakfast room service with the exception of a continental for $14
they do encourage you to order what you would like and they will accomodate
I ordered two poached eggs
toast and jelly
a small fruit bowl and coffee
I got this but with only one piece of toast and no jelly and charged $27
On checking out
I wanted to discuss this with someone and asked for a form or whatever
I was told by the surly front desk lady
Put it on Trip Advisor
so heeeerrree you go Iroquois
maybe you should have a chat with this lady
