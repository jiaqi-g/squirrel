Third time staying at The Iroquois, and wouldn't contemplate staying anywhere else. Everything it at the highest standard. A hotel you can actually look forward to come back to. The beds are so hard to get out of because they are so comfy!!! The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms are gorgeous. Great location and the staff is polite and helpful. Can't wait to be back in July!
