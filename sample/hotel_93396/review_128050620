I stayed at the Iroquois for 2 nights recently on a cheap rate of $229/night from Expedia. I do not typically stay in the Times Square neighborhood because it is dirty, noisy, and crowded with tourists, but I had business meetings up and down the West side so for this trip it made sense. If you like to take public transportation, you can hardly get more central or accessible than Times Square. 
When I arrived I was greeted warmly and checked in efficiently, and throughout my stay the staff was friendly and helpful. My room was tiny and dark with one small window looking out into an air shaft, but not uncomfortable, and I had a nice and immaculately clean bathroom. The furniture and carpet are a bit outdated and worn, but not terribly so. The photos on the hotel's website seem to be a pretty accurate representation--one photo resembled my room almost exactly. For a solo traveler, my tiny room was fine, but it would be a bit tight for more than one person.
As a place to just come home and sleep--which is essentially what I did--the Iroquois was more than adequate. And for the price I paid, I felt it was a very good value. However, I was surprised to see when looking at their regular rates that a room like mine often sells for over $500/night. Had I paid $500 for this room I would have been outraged--this isn't a $500/night room, and honestly, charming as it is, in my opinion it's not a $500/night hotel. 
So watch Expedia and other sites for good rates and if you are taking a trip to NY to see shows, this is a good home base for the right price.
