My husband and I spent Saturday and Sunday night at the Iroquois
I had stayed once there before with a friend and decided then that I could stop trying different hotels in NYC
The staff are friendly
helpful and accomodating
The room (we had a king executive this time) was large
clean and comfortable
We really don't spend much time in the hotel room
but you do have to sleep and clean up there
and the facilities were fantastic
The linens and bed are great
and the bathroom was large
spotless
lighted and had plenty of towels
hot water and water pressure
We were given a bottle of wine and chocolates
which were delicious
and it was nice to find a fresh bottle of Perrier when we arrived back in the evening
We had breakfast at Triomphe
and it was delicious with prompt and attentive service
and delicious food
The location can't be beat
We will definitely stay there next trip
