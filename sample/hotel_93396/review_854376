This small hotel is among the most charming, attentive, accommodating, and comfortable places I've visited. Although the rooms are a bit small, they are cleverly arranged so that I never felt cramped. The beds are clean, comfortable, and full of fluffy pillows. The staff is friendly, and knew me by name after my first night. The restaurant is top-notch, too. A very nice stay!
