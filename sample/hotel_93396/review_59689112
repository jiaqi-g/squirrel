A true beauty in the heart of a bustling metropolis. The Iroquois is truly a rare, boutique hotel, with exquisite touches, service and amenities. 
My friend and I stayed for 4 nights - we arrived on St. Patrick's Day. Even though we arrived early in the morning, the very friendly gentleman at the front desk allowed us to check-in immediately. Our room was on the top floor, tucked away in the back, so street noise was very minimal...yet the open windows provided lots of fresh air and natural light. Nightly turndown service was such a treat!
The room - without a doubt, every detail was well thought through. The crisp sheets, coomfy mattress, luxurious robes, doorbell (we were so impressed we pressed it many times) - and the Molton Brown toiletties absolutely spa quality.
The service - every staff member was very friendly and extremely helpful. Even when I came back from my run each afternoon (and looked like I didn't belong in such a fine hotel), the doorman, front desk personnel, all greeted me with warm, friendly smiles. 
The price - being from Canada, we were fortunate that the Canadian dollar has been relatively strong of late. The price we paid was comparable to a 3-star hotel in midtown Manhattan. It may have been we booked relatively early...but throughout our research on hotels, the Iroquois provided the best deal - and given the luxurious, high quality of this hotel, I say we got an amazing deal.
Without any hesitation, I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends. I was a bit concerned with the location, being so close to Broadway...but the street (W 44th) was relatively quiet and we slept through each night without any noise disturbances.
Thank you to the Iroquios staff for such an amazing stay.
