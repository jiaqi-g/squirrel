My husband and I just returned from a one night stay at The Iroiquois
We had an overnight layover in NYC coming from Rome on our way home to San Diego
We decided to stay at the Iroquois due to the reviews posted on TA and because it is a member of the "Small Luxury Hotels of the World"
It lived up to the SLH standard of excellence
Upon arrival
we were upgraded to a deluxe superior room which was elegantly appointed with a luxurious bed
plasma TV and Molton Brown toiletries
In addition
this hotel is centrally located in the theatre district
We were very satisfied with the service and the room and would recommend this hotel
