Small boutique hotel close to Times square
we stayed a week
The first room we were on was on the first floor with poor view(despite us asking for a room higher up)
The hotel moved us the following day for the rest of our stay
Not many amenities
there was a small gym with sauna
basically a converted room
but it did the job
2 bars
one a cocktail bar but we preferred the restaurant bar which had an excellent barman
The restaurant (for evening meals) was expensive but fantastic
If you want a special meal absolutely eat here
Negatives: The restaurant and bars closed totally for Jewish holidays
Now I respect the owners religious beliefs BUT when operating a hotel for international guests we were surprised to have everything locked up for 2 days
The breakfast was expensive but it's easily fixed by walking out the front door
turning right and eating the the Red flame diner 100 yards along the road
Really good selection at reasonable prices
Floor 8 also smelt of damp
This is the floor with the James Dean suite in it
The staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you
The beds were comfortable and for the price we paid for the hotel in a very central location was great
We'd definitely stay again
