I just came back from a 1 night stay at the Iroquois, after spending 2 nights at the Intercontinental Barclay a few blocks away. 
What a pleasant surprise! This was the epitome of a 'boutique" hotel. Smaller, with great service, nice attention to the rooms. I had a queen bed in a corner room that was absolutely quiet. Although there was no view, I faced into the back side of the hotels with other rooms and no street traffic. The bed was nice, the room nicely decorated. The bathroom was small, but had nice fixtures, marble floors and a full bathtub with sliding glass doors. I had a fairly decent sized closet that didn't take away from the space in the room. The A/C was working well, and not too loud.
The lobby was always pleasant and the bellboys very attentive. 
The other great point was the location on 44th, right next to the Sofitel. The street does not get a lot of taxis and no buses, but packed with limos and private cars so it's quieter. Also right at 5th Ave and all the tourist attractions. 
I'd definitely stay here again, highly recommend it!
