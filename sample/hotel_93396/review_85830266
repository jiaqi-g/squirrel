The Iroquois provides an excellent and convenient location for sightseeing NY
close to 5th Av
and half way between Central Park and The Empire State Building
which are both in walking distance
If one prefers a smaller hotel with good service and ever better restaurant and you do not need the full set of facilities of the big hotels the Iroquois is a great choice and you will be suprised on the very reasonable price for that category in NYC
You may spend more money at other locations and get less
