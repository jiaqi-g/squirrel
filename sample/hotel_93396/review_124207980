We have spent the New Year's Eve in NY and have stayed at the Iroquois. Very nice and helpful staff. Especially Vanessa! She was very nice and helpful with all our inquiries. The room was very clean and comfortable, nice linings and good bed! Everything about this hotel was a lovely surprise! We strongly recommend it !
