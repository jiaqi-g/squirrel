I had the pleasure of staying at The Iroquois for a couple of nights this week as my girlfriend was in New York for business. This hotel, like anything worthwhile in Manhattan, is pricy, but even if I had to pay out of my own pocket for a future trip I would consider it because it was a phenomenal experience all-around!
The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. This includes the front desk who checked us in, the doormen who assisted us with hotel umbrellas in the rain and the gentleman who stowed our luggage before check-in and after check-out. 
The hotel itself is small, but very elegant. The little "New York Library" room is great with comfortable couches, computer terminals and a small but great collection of books about the city. Complementary hot coffee in the morning and cider in the afternoon was great on a chilly day. 
The room was small, but very classy. The washroom was one of the best hotel washrooms I've ever been in and the bed was extremely comfortable. Turn-down service was offered in the evening and was a nice touch. 
The location is fabulous with a 5min walk to Times Square, even less to the highly-reccomended Bryant Park. Plenty of great places to eat in the area from fine dining to take-out pizza. The block around the hotel was suburb. It was safe, not overly crowded and very welcoming. 
I would highly recommend the Iroquois to anyone who doesn't mind spending a little bit more cash to do New York in style!
