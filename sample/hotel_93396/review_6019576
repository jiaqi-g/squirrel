My husband and I had a guarenteed reservation made weeks ago
Our reservation was for a larger room with a queen bed
We arrived and were told we had a double bed
which meant the room was very small
I showed the desk clerk our quarenteed reservation
I was told the hotel DID NOT quarentee their bed size? We went with the bellman to look at the room
With the three of us in the room there was no floor space left
The bed looked smaller than a double
We refused the room and my husband went looking for another hotel
I waited in the lobby with our luggage
while I waited several guests checked in and were giver a larger room with a queen bed
i asked why our reservation was not honored and was told the other people were with a group? Fortunately we were able to find another hotel at a higher rate
DO NOT STAY HERE
The hotel is not to be trusted to honor you confirmed reservation
