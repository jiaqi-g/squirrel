I took my daughter here for her !6th Birthday. We loved the location. It was easy to get around. the staff was great. A special thank you to Alan for his dinner recommendation. The room was small but the beds were very comfortable after a long day sightseeing. They accommodated our request for a late checkout and secured a ride back to the airport. Will definitely return!
