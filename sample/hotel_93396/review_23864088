We got a rate of under $200 for this hotel
So based on that price I would give it 3 stars
If I had paid more I would have been unhappy
The hotel is in a good location
It is safe
The rooms are small but it's New York City
The negatives
The rooms are insanely dark
Which makes getting ready for two people quite a challenge b/c you are restricted to the bathroom mirror
So the other person cannot be in the bathroom at the same time
The concierge seems to be bothered when asked questions and usually wrong with the best way to get to places and incorrect subway stops
They are very slow with responding to requests
We waited 40 minutes for a roll of toilet paper
The bed is positioned about 18 inches from the hallway wall and it runs along the wall so you feel is if you are sleeping in the hallway when people are walking/talking thru the hall
It is really annoying
Don't take the hummer that is parked outside of the hotel (he is not affiliated with the hotel) he is 3x the rate of a taxi
Plus if you did take him once he will hound you the rest of the trip and he seriousily is parked outside the hotel all day and all night trying to get money (which he has to make a living but it is very irritating)
The hotel is in a great location and it is clean and comfortable for under $200 or even $300 I would maybe be ok with it
Anymore than that and I feel you would be very disappointed
