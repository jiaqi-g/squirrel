We had a wonderful girls weekend away there. Requested early check-in which was cheerfully accomodated - Elvis at the front desk was terrific. Room although typically small for the city was well appointed, space used effectively. Very clean!! Beds extremely comfortable. Concierge on both days was very helpful - loved that as we left in the rain for breakfast umbrellas were offered with a warm smile. Small issue that one of the elevators is being repaired - twice we waited between 4-6 minutes for an elevator because people were checking in and out and there was a lot of activity and bags getting on/off elevator.
