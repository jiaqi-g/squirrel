The location - right off Times Square and not far from St. Patrick's, Rockefeller, etc. - is ideal. The staff was really great. The downside was that the room was really tiny. I didn't expect a lot and I can deal with small spaces but I barely had room to move around. The dark colors probably made it feel smaller than it was but I've got nothing against the decor really. The other downside was the bed. It drives me crazy when the mattress sinks in the middle and that's what happened with this bed. I didn't sleep well at all. The gym was good - a few cardio machines and weights which was totally fine. Overall not too bad but I'd probably search out another hotel during my next trip to the city.
