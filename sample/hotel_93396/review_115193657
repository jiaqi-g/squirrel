When we checked in a young lady (Caroline or Carolyn, I'm not sure of the spelling) asked if we were in NYC for anything special.."Yes, our fifth wedding anniversary." A short time later chocolates, wine and a congratulatory card were sent to our room compliments of the hotel. What a thoughtful gesture! To a person the staff; housekeepers, desk personnel, doormen and concierge were friendly, courteous, helpful and professional without any hint of snobbishness. The bed was comfortable and room flawlessly clean. Many of New York's attractions were an easy stroll away and a cooler of fresh lemonade in the lobby was a refreshing touch after a stroll. Will most assuredly come back and can, with confidence, recommend The Iroquois.
