My husband and I stayed Feb 18
21 for an extraordinary three nights in a one bedroom suite with separate shower and jacuzzi tub on the 11th floor facing the street
We had the absolute best stay here and can't complain about anything
Andy at the front desk was terrific in helping make our stay perfect
Nick the concierge was so wonderful and really went the extra mile for us
Rocky was wonderful as were two of the front doormen who walked us up to 5th Ave to get taxis
talk about going out of your way for guests
Everyone was so friendly and helpful at the hotel and the personal touch of knowing who we were made us feel welcome and very special
Our suite was so perfect and pristine
decorated in beautiful tones with blackout shades for sleeping in
One of the best things was the charm and intimate European feel of the hotel
not one of those huge McHotels where no one knows who you are and lacks any charm or character
Great little spot in the hotel for continental breakfast that was complimentary and got wonderful special welcome "treats" in our room with lovely personal notes and morning paper at our door
This location is perfect for walking all over midtown and getting around
Thanks to all at the Iroquois
we will be back to visit our son and you
