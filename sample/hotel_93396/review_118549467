We stayed at the Iroquois Hotel in late August 2011. After starting out our trip late due to flight delays, we arrived I the wee hours at the hotel, where the staff promptly checked us in and welcomed us. The bellman John gave us a quick tour of the room which was cozy, but well appointed and s god condition. The hotel is 2 blocks from Times Square, 2 blocks from Bryant Park which is an excellent location for breakfast and about 5 blocks south of Rockefeller Center. Various subway stations are also within a few blocks and thus the hotel is perfect location to access the entire island of Manhattan. Great neighbourhood too. Never felt unsafe, shopping on 5th and Madison is right there as well . . .although you will want to subway north a number blocks from Grand Central station to get to Bloomingdales. Macy's is about 5 blocks south as is the Empire State Building. All in all, was a gat hotel in a great location.
