Stayed at this hotel in March for our first visit to New York – our first visit to America, in fact – and we could have hardly chosen a better place. Very conveniently situated, with the shuttle bus from Newark Airport dropping us only a couple of blocks away, and Times Square very close. Warm welcome, and friendly, courteous service all through our stay. We asked for a quiet room towards the rear of the hotel and away from the elevators, and they were more than happy to oblige. Our room was very spacious and comfortable, with two queen-sized beds. Complimentary coffee available in the lobby all morning, replaced by warm honey-flavoured cider in the afternoon and evening – a great boon on cold March days in New York. Free wi-fi in our bedroom, plus two computers and a printer available for guests in the lobby. A great place to stay, and we fully intend to be back.
