My 3 best friends and I don't get together often and planned a girls' night in NYC.The Iroquois exceeded our already high expectations. As soon as we walked in to the hotel, we were greeted warmly by the courteous staff and loved the clean and comfortable room. It felt cozy and elegant at the same time. We enjoyed the extra touches, such as the complimentary items and turn-down service. We all said we will definitely be coming back soon and will bring our significant others soon.
