We stayed at the Iroquois for five nights from 5th August. We had two rooms as we had my elderly parents with us. My mum is quite disabled and can only walk a few steps but nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were always genuinely friendly and gave you the impression they really did want to help. The rooms just ooze class, with immaculate reproduction edwardian style furniture, stylish decoration and several lamps to give a warm, cosy feel- a real home from home! All the mod cons are there too- free Wi-Fi, flat screen TV, an Ipod docking station with speakers, a DVD player with a free 200 + title DVD library in reception. Fabulous beds, beautifully clean and luxurious bathrooms, complimentary bathrobes, evening turndown service with proper european milk chocolstes left on the bed with a little weather forecast card for the next day, a safe and iron and ironing board mean everything you need is here. 
There's a very good quality award winning restaurant in house (Triomphe), but we were on a limited budget so only ate there once. Most mornings we ate at the Red Flame, turn right out of the hotel and walk 50 yards- excellent, filling, good value no-frills food. The hotel location is just perfect- far enough away from Times Square to be quiet, but just a five minute walk to it when you want to see the bright lights and soak up the atmosphere! Radio City is just around the corner and the theares of Broadway are only 5-10 minutes walk away also. As others have mentioned, take the Gray Line tours at $54 for unlimited 48 hour use of their four most popular tours. Also, for cheaper theatre tickets on the day, go to the clearance ticket booths behind the seating stand in Times Square- they open from 11:00 for matinees and 15:00 for evening performances. 
Overall, this is probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in. For the price they charge for the rooms it's an absolute bargain!
