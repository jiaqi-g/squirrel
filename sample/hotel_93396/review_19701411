We stayed at the Iroquois from Aug
I was dissapointed when we arrived as I had a different impression of the hotel from the website
The hotel was OK
but nothing special
I had read some reviews about the lobby being under construction months ago
the lobby was still under construction when we arrived
The hotel just seemed runned down
very very small and the hallways and rooms needed upgrading
For example
the carpets looked dingy and old and there were large gaps between the doors so light go was beeming through the front door
I was just overall dissapointed considering we also had a deluxe room
The hotel was ok and I am sure most people would have found it ok
but I was expecting more
I think there are better hotels for the same price
