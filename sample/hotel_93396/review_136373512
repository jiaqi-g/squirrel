I spent a week in NYC on my own a few months back and I highly recommend this boutique Hotel
It was perfect
Ideal location with 5th Avenue being at one end and Times Square being two blocks at the other end
although once inside the Hotel you wouldn't know that you were in the hub of YC with how quiet it was
The room was lovely
the concierge were fantastic (hello sold out Ice Hockey tickets)
the bottle of wine
sparkling water and chocolates on arrival were appreciated and I got upgraded which was fabulous
The staff were really attentive
remembering everything that I told them the next day and overall very sweet
Being on my own I felt very safe being there and the amazing location meant everything was easily accessible late at night without the need to even get a taxi
I loved the fact there was a Duane Reade just around the corner for late night drinks
snacks and nail polish too
They had the cutest turn down service where chocolates and the weather for the following day were placed on your pillow
oh and the gorgeous bath products meant I was always wrapped up in a Molton Brown cocoon before bed
