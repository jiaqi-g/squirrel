Great location next to Times Square and fifth avenue and lots of subway stations.
Stayed for four nights with friends.
Beds extremely cosy, bathroom decent, room clean, although the bath could do with a decent deep scrub. Ipod docking station to listen to your music whilst getting ready. 
I liked the convenience of the red flame diner on the same road and the deli around the corner on fifth avenue for a toasted sandwich in the morning.
My room (401) on the 4th floor had no fridge, a view of the fire escape and brick walls, but I wasn't in New York to stare out the window, my friends in room 1208 (12th flr) had a similar view.
The staff were friendly enough, although not very warm, they recommended a restaurant around the corner (Oprah Winfrey's favourite apparently) which I wasn't too keen on, although I'm sure others may enjoy.
