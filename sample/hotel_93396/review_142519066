We just came home from a wonderful weekend in NYC and a stay at the Iroquois Hotel.
Not only is the location excellent, but the entire staff extremely helpful, accomodating and courteous. We were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the Presidential suite which was absolutely first rate. We have stayed at the Iroquois on several other occasions in the past and will continue to make this our stop away from home whenever we are in the city. Kudos to this wonderful staff.
