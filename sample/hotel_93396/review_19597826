My wife and I stayed at Iroquois for five nights in late August
We went on the recommendation of our travel agent who got us a good deal on this property
When we arrived in mid
afternoon we were somewhat surprised that there was no door person to greet us and help us with our luggage
When we did get inside the hotel
however
(the lobby is currently under construction)
staff were helpful and check in was a breeze
As stated in previous reviews
the rooms are quite small
We had requested a Superior Room with king size bed
which we got
The bed took up easily 75% of the room
The washroom was big enough
with the usual amenities
The bed and pillows were very comfortable
The chamber staff was very efficient
Rooms were always made by early afternoon
In the evening
the turndown service
complete with Belgian chocolate
was much appreciated
Location in the theatre district and close to Times Square was also great
While hotel staff was very helpful
the concierge desk was not always staffed
The hotel only has two rather small elevators
which are in great need of upgrade
At times in the morning
the wait for an elevator with space was often more than five minutes
Overall
the stay was pleasant
But at an average of about $375/night
I have a feeling there are other properties which would provide better value for our dollar
