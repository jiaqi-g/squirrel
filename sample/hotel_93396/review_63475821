We booked this holiday through Expedia and would never go with this company again
Their customer service assistance is non existant
We arrived in NY on 29 April 2010 and booked into the Iroquois for 4 nights
The hotel is very well situated for either 5th Avenue (come out and turn left) or Times Square (turn right out of hotel)
It is also a bit quieter than other city centre hotels
you dont hear the same amount of traffic noise there
The room was a little small
we had two 'double beds' which were smaller than UK beds so fitting two people in them comfortably was difficult
We ended up sleeping in separate beds just to get a sleep
The problem is that they have too much furniture in a room that size
Not a massive issue but there is no place to keep suitcases etc
The the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathrobes and Molton Brown toiletries were a nice touch
The bonus for us was having free wi
fi in the room
you can also use the computer and printer in the library free of charge which is great if you need to print off boarding passes etc
We ate at the Red Flame diner next to the hotel for breakfast and it was good
fast service and good selection
We did the bus tours and went to Woodbury Common which is about 1hr away on a bus
it s a massive shopping outlet with a lot of big designer names
got a few bargains there
Overall had a good time
like the hotel but unfortunately got stuck and an airport hotel for an extra two nights due the latest volcanic ash cloud
