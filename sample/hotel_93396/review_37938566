We loved the Iroquois Hotel for its charm and quaintness and wonderful location between 5th and 6th Avenue on West 44th Street. The front desk staff was very welcoming and attentive. We had a room upgrade without even asking for one which was a nice gesture as well. the room was well appointed with a beautiful marble bathroom and Molton Brown soaps. The Frette sheets and towels were the topping on the cake! my husband was able to keep up with e-mails using the complimentary Wi-Fi in the room. We also took advantage of the concierge keeping our luggage after we checked out at no charge-we will visit again!!
