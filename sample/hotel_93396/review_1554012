We stayed over X
mas in 2003
I will confirm that the rooms were tiny but they were very clean
The service was good but we paid a little more than we would usually on tips etc
based on a previous a review
We had a little child and they did their best to accommodate us in a boutique
style hotel
Overall no major complaints
A great place for a weekend getaway for a couple (if you get a deal <$250/night)
The hotel is situated and there is corner store close by with fresh fruit etc
walking distcance to Rockfellar and Times Square was a bonus
