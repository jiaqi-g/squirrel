Spent New Year's Eve and a few extra nights there. The location is excellent: walking distance to many sights, restaurants and all the action. Also steps away from the subway if you need to go downtown, or off the island.
The rooms were excellent, clean, spacious and great beds. The bathrooms could have been slightly better (shower didn't work very well).
Would stay here again.
