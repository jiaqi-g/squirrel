We went to NY for my wife's 60th birthday and our 40th anniversary.
The Iroquois upgraded us on arrival to a corner room that was away from the street. The refurbished room was fitted out with period fixtures to match the age of this iconic hotel, though it took some figuring out to operate the shower tap. It needed to be pulled out, as well as turned, to get the shower head to work.
The staff were very friendly and helpful for our entire stay. The hotel is close to the theatres, Times Square and MOMA.
If you want a good restaurant, almost next door is DB bistro moderne (see danielnyc.com). Great coffee can be had at Greg's across the road. If you want THE best restaurant, go to Eleven Madison Park. Spectacular!!!
