My wife and I had a very nice stay at The Iroquois from Jul. 26th to Jul. 30th.
Pros: location is excellent, a short walk to Times Square on a quiet street. We went to Radio City Music Hall for show, and to Rockefeller Centre to Top of the Rock and these were just a nice walk away. Check out Gregory's Coffee across the street, they have excellent coffee and try the pound cake, yummy! Also close to tons of restaurants close. The Red Flame Diner is a great spot for a very reasonably priced tasty bite. We went for breakfast, was very good.
Service was very good. The concierge was very helpful. We found everyone to be quite friendly and it had a personal touch.
The hotel was old in a good way, it had character and nice touches. It was very clean and quaint.
We got a competitive rate on a package deal and was satisfied with value for this property.
Cons: Our room was very small, which I understand is typical of Manhatten, however it was much smaller than another Manhatten hotel we stayed in last year. Also it had no view, just into another room's Window and a brick wall. Most disappointing was the bed, which was much shorter than standard size perhaps needed to fit into the small room. I'm well over 6 ft tall wasn't the most comfortable. Also my wife was surprised they didn't have a hairdryer, which is typically standard in most hotels. 
Overall we enjoyed our stay at The Iroquois, the best points being it's location and service. I would return in a larger room with at least some view and larger bed.
