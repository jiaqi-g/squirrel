I have stayed at many large chain luxury hotels (Ritz Carlton, Four Season, Fairmont), none of which have the charm and personal touch that we experienced at The Iroquois. When we checked in the bellman went above and beyond, helping my family. The hotel GM, Scott Geres, was in the lobby and introduced himself and provided his contact information should we need anything. Our suite was OUTSTANDING! Top notch flat screen TV's in bedroom and living room. Very clean, comfortable furniture, bedding, and larger than any hotel suite I have stayed in, with bottle of wine and chocolates welcoming us. The concierge was also very helpful providing us with maps, reservations, and directions. The location could not be better. We walked to all of our desired destinations (shopping on 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center, Broadway shows, Times Square). When we left the hotel to go see a show on broadway the staff not only provided turn down service but set up the sofa sleeper, which was a very pleasant surprise after returning. If you are looking for a small luxury hotel in THE BEST location with better service and more charm than the above mentioned industry giants, book a room here!
