this is a great small hotel. the linens are first class, the bathroom is very clean and modern. one of the best showers i have ever had in a hotel room, the hot water came in immediately and lots of water force from the shower.
the only complaint i have is that the room is dark. dark blinds on the windows and only three lights in the room. i ended up taking the shade off the lights to get more light. also, the do not disturb notice is on the doorbell and not a hanging sign. because we did not know where to turn the sign on, we were disturbed both mornings at 8:30 and one afternoon, the maid just walked in while we were in the room.
also, if you have a car there is not a designated area to park in front of the hotel to check in and no valet. the parking garage is across the street with a discount of the daily rate for hotel guests - $30 per day. small inconvience but certainly doesn't take anything away from the hotel.
nice little bar off the lobby, closed on sundays.
