Having stayed in NYC 3 times since 2004
including at the Waldorf Astoria last time
I have to say they all pale in comparison to the Iroquois
I can see why people think the rooms are small having seen other rooms however we had a suite which was superb value for money and was exceptionally good
The best asset of the Iroquis is it's staff with particular mention to Bill
Carlos
Manik
Nick (who sorted out the best chocolate cake ever for my Fiancee's birthday
and the excellent Reception and Breakfast staff
I thoroughly recommend the 'unusual' Triomphe French Toast as a treat in the morning
Overall I don't think I'd ever stay anywhere else in NYC if I could help it
