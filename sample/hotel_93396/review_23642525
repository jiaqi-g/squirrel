Stayed for four nights at this small hotel
Great room
excellent decor and amenities
Good staff and great level of cleanliness
Most comfortable beds ever
Amazing position just a short walk away from a lot of the main sites
including times square
shopping on 5th avenue
rockerfella centre etc
Brilliant diner called the red flame a few doors down
best place for breakfast or a quick snack
Excellent value for money
everything you could possibly need in a bustling city
A little bit of luxury to retreat from the madness
Would definately stay there again
