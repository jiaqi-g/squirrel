We stayed here for a week at the end of March 2012. We had booked in for 7 nights and had opted for a deluxe room to get a bit of extra space. Patrick at Reception upgraded us to an executive room, and we were allowed to have it immediately, although it was an hour before official check-in time. We were on the 7th floor, at the back of the hotel. The room was a good size (unlike London) and we unpacked both our cases in to drawers and the closet, with enough room in the closet to store both large suitcases. The bathroom was particularly spacious, with a powerful shower. We liked the free shoeshine service, just like the old days, where you put your shoes out last thing at night, and take them in early next morning, all shined up! As mentioned by others, the hotel is perfectly positioned a couple of blocks from Times Square, with about 100 eating places easily walked to. All the subway stations are easily walked to, and the Empire State building is about 20 mins walk away in one direction, with Central Park an equal distance in the opposite direction. Vanessa at the Concierge Desk could not have been more helpful with directions, suggested walking routes, and advice on places to eat. This would be our first choice of hotels to stay in on return to New York. Don't miss breakfast at the Red Flame Diner, two doors along from the hotel: typical big American breakfasts served with a smile!
