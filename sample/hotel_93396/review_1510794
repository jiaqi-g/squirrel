Our room was tiny for the price we paid. We have stayed in many other hotels in NYC for less money and have had much more space. We had one small roller suitcase which we didn't need help with, but the bellhop was determined to help us, and then when we gave him a $2 tip, we heard him mutter under his breath (but so we could hear),"two dollars!" in a disgusted voice. That set the tone for our stay very nicely. Nice bathroom (it was about half the size of the bedroom). Overall, you can definitely get better value elsewhere. We wouldn't stay there again.
