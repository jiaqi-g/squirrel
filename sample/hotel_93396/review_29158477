Just returned from our stay at The Iroquois and can't recommend this hotel highly enough. Our king size room was kept very clean and the bed was so big and comfortable. The staff are courteous but not in your face, sometimes someone is on the door but not all the time but personally I don't need anyone to open the door for me each time. The location is perfect, walking distance to Times Square, Broadway, Rockefeller, Empire State, Macy's and Central Park. There is a a diner just a few yards down the road which does a good breakfast if you want more than just continental. All in all a great place to stay and I would definitely book there again.
