Having travelled extensively throughout Nth America we have stayed in many hotels
As it was our 30th wedding anniversary we were looking for somewhere special to stay
The Iroquois performed way beyond our expectations
The Location is perfect
Within walking distance to many of the things to love about New York and with easy access to the Subway & Taxi services
The staff are both friendly and professional
I had a hiccup with our booking and was "Listened" to in a courteous and friendly manner
The situation was resolved quickly which says volumes for the Hotel and staff
The Room was very clean and comfortable and YES the BEDS are wonderful and much appreciated after a day out and about
There are some great restaurants within walking distance (if you like Indian try the one on the next block towards times sq)
From the time of the "Concierge arranged" town car picking us up at the airport to the time it deposited it us back to leave
our stay at the Iroquois was a high point in our visit to New York City
We will definitely return to the Iroquis next time we are in New York and are telling all our friends in Australia about it
Try it for a truly pleasant experience
