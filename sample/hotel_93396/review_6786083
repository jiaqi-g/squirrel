This was my second time staying at The Iroquois
Last year my husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay so much that I booked a room there when traveling with a girlfriend to NYC for 4 nights
I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the front desk staff and one of the doormen were still there
a sign of a good hotel when they can keep staff
My husband and I had been upgraded to an executive king for our stay and I have to say that our room
on the back of the hotel
was exceptionally quiet and comfortable
I was alittle worried when I was learned that the classic doubles
which I booked for a girlfriend and me
weren't located in the rear of the hotel and therefore might be noisier
I really had no cause to worry
This time we were on the top floor (12) and while we had little in the way of a view
the room was perfectly comfortable
exceptionally clean
and almost as quiet as the room my husband and I had
The beds are incredibly comfy
the soft linens
terrific pillows
and great mattress
made for some very comfortable sleep
The marble bathroom is a delight even if it is on the small size
The plasma tvs are quite large and of very good quality
The hotel feels very European
which I prefer
over some of our oversized American hotel chains
While there is no coffee pot in the room
there is free coffee downstairs and continental breakfast (cereal
yogurt
fruit
coffee
juice) delivered to your room is very reasonable (there was so much food the two of us could share one breakfast)
We also enjoyed having a drink and some small plates in the hotel bar where the staff is friendly and unpretenious
The location of this hotel is perfect
There are a number of hotels on 44th so cabs are readily available
You can go downtown easily by walking to Fifth Avenue and uptown by walking to 6th Avenue
Since our daughter lives in NYC I expect to return and plan on staying at The Iroquois again where I feel very welcome and can relax in a calm environment
