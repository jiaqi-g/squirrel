Located near the theaters and great shopping this hotel has been only perfect on every one of our many stays
The desk crew always remember your name and your preferences concerning the location of your room
we have requested early check in and we recieved that perk
The bellman have been at this hotel forever and for good reason
they know their jobs and are always up
Now the rooms
we have always stayed in one of the suites which are spacious and comfortable
There is a sitting room
separate bedroom and bathroom with a spa tub and a stall shower
Did I mention the robes and slippers
newspapers and special stuff like berries and nuts
cheese
bottled water
chocolates that just "appear" in your room
When we bring our teenage grandsons we get a suite with an adjoining room for them and it is roomy enough for the four od us
It just does not get any better than this
We will be back in October
