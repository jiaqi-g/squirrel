My spouse and I travel to New York City every year to relax after the caos of yet another holiday season. For the past for years we have stayed at The Iroquois Hotel on 44th St. between 5th and 6th Avenue. Over those 4 years I have been introduced to the General Manager,Mr. Scott Geres, and have explained to him our situation about traveling to NYC to relax and enjoying the many fine dining establishments for our own personal research. Whether it is a hotel policy or simply the recognition from Mr. Geres that we return yearly, the Iroquois' detail to attention and customer satisfaction far exceed any other experience we've had in New York. From many great recommendations of where to eat, shop, sights to see or the latest touch, a series of cookbooks found in our room upon arrival showcasing some of NYC finest chefs, it shows Mr. Geres and the staff at The Iroquois, pays attention to its clientelle. Once again The Iroqouis Hotel delivered the experience my spouse and I so desire and will continue to visit again next year. Respectfully, Mr. Andrew Ottati
