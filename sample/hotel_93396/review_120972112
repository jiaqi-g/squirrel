Impeccable hotel
rooms are small but well equiped and immaculate
Centrally located
a short walk from Times Square (away from the hustle and bustle)
The service was incredible
friendly staff with two concierge personnel
Vanessa and Alan
who were resourceful and spot
on with suggestions and opinions
Would recommend this hotel without hesitation
Visiting NYC for the first time was a wonderful experience for us
partly because of staying at this hotel
5 stars
