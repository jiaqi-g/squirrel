My wife and i stayed at the Iroquois over the weekend as we did dinner and a broadway show and made a great weekend of it
She wanted a larger hotel like the W but i was interested in the Iroquois because of the history behind it and being a smaller boutique hotel i had higher expectations
I was very disappointed
The only high points were the bed and pillows which were large and comfortable
That was pretty much it
The room was tiny
and holding a king size bed it seemed even smaller
The bathroom was also quite small and my wife and i had to shift around each other to both get ready to go out
On top of that
the bar closed very early for a Friday night
We came back to the hotel around 12:30am expecting to have a few drinks and were let down as it was already closed for the evening
To sum things up
the front desk was a bit snooty and annoyed when we had questions
Being a native New Yorker
it took all my energy not to lose my temper as i didnt appreciate being treated badly and i now know why New Yorkers get such a bad reputation as being so rude as they were quite nasty
