The Iroquois is like the Algonquin, a unique hotel. It had loads of olde worlde charm, exquisitely mannered staff, great location and such a relaxing bedroom. I have stayed here twice and same consistent memorable experience. I wish there were more such non-chain hotels to make it all feel a little different.
