Our stay at The Iroquois Hotel in New York City was great
The room was extremely clean and comfortable
I wanted to take that bed home with me
The location was very convenient
We were 1 block from the Theatre District and 2 blocks from Times Square and very close to the subways
The staff was very courteous and informative
The night manager
Alex Cabrera
was the best
He treated us as though we were the only guests at the hotel and treated us as friends
I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would definitely return
