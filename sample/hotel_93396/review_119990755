The small hotel has not compromised on class. The staff are friendly and very helpful. In the front of the lobby, looking out on 44th street is "the library" - truly a place to sit and read or access the Internet with printer.
You can park yourself at a garage across the street or use the valet service for $10 more. The location is two blocks from Times Square and most theatres. The Algonqin is a few doors away.
The bed was extremely comfortable.
A restaurant is available through the lobby and an intimate bar with approximately a dozen tables for post theatre drinks.
A comfortable place where you can feel safe and secure
