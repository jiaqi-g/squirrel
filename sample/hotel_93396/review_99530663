Spent five days at The Iroquois and had a great experience
The location of the hotel was first rate; perfect for the theater
The hotel is only two blocks from Times Square but distant enough from the crowds and noise to offer a relaxing stay
Free internet and dvd's
dailly newspaper
coffee and tea added to the home
like atmosphere
The staff was very friendly
especially the concierges
In particular
Vanessa was a gem
Not only a pleasure to talk with
her recommendations and assistance with restaurant reservations and theater tickets were fantastic
Would definitely stay here again
