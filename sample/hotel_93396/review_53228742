The rare but ultimate Christmas holiday in NYC was only enhanced by the stay at The Iroquois Hotel
From check in to check out we were treated with respect
friendliness and always attended to
Special thanks and note of appreciation to Nick Mullins
Concierge
for his friendly outlook
attention to details
and his selection of restaurants for the holiday season
Well done
everyone
