We have stayed at this hotel before but found that the level of comfort and service has gone down.
The Iroquois hotel is in an excellent location in midtown Manhattan. The staff is very accommodating. The provided continental breakfast was good.
However, the room was small and we had trouble with one of the bed lights not working, the air conditioning not cooling the room adequately and the hot water for the shower never getting more than warm. There was also a lack of available electric outlets in our room for computer power. Also we found the lighting in the lobby and the room to be inadequate.
None of the negatives mentioned above are more than minor complaints but they did add up and diminished our enjoyment of the hotel, which we have previously found to be quite good on all counts. Since the Iroquois is rated more favorably on Tripadvisor than some of its close by neighbors, which we have enjoyed, we thought that it would be wise to let fellow travelers know that there are other good choices in the neighborhood
