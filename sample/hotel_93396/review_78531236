I booked the Iroquois very last
minute
based entirely on its high TA ranking
It was expensive at around $300 per night
but that's what you get for booking at the 11th hour
First impressions are good
location is perfect for midtown
sandwiched between the Algonquin and the Sofitel on 44th Street
barely a block from Times Square
The small
compact reception is more reminiscent of a European boutique hotel
and service is of the usual standard you'd expect at this level of hotel
Room 1002 seemed fairly typical of most rooms in the hotel
first and foremost
they are tiny
Even by European standards this was small
not a problem for a solo business traveller
but I would have enjoyed it a lot less had I been there with my wife
The large walk
in closet helps though
as it provides plenty of room to store clothing and luggage out of the way
Big TV
DVD player and iPod dock were all good
the desk was small but functional
The free in
room WiFi was quick to access and 100% reliable during my 3
day stay
Furnishings and extras are all of good quality
Morning coffee in reception and iced water in the evenings was a nice touch
There are always a few gripes
which I'll list here:
although there are 2 elevators
one goes so slowly it's almost in reverse
During the morning rush
it could take a long time to get up and down the floors
the lack of visible staff late at night was unusual
and I did wonder what would stop one of midtown's less salubrious residents from pitching up for the night in the lobby
Didn't see any problems though
no fridge was provided in the room
a tray of room
temperature minibar products were on the counter and a fridge had to be requested if required
Why??
Overall though
nothing that would put me off staying again
I would hope for a much better rate booking in advance
