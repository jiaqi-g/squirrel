My husband surprised me with a trip to New York as a birthday treat so I didn't having any input into choosing the hotel -but he did an amazing job in choosing The Iriquois! From the moment we arrived we were made to feel like welcome guests. Every member of staff from the doorman to the housekeeper was more than pleasant. We had a executive king room which was very spacious and had all the amenities you could want, including the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. We were also given a direct dial number for the telephone which was really useful for keeping in contact with home. We did not have breakfast in the hotel but used the Red Flame Diner a few doors down where we got ample supplies of pancakes, syrup and coffee!
For us, the hotel could not be in a better location (between Fifth and Sixth Avenue). It is only a few minutes from Rockerfeller Centre, Radio City and St. Patrick's Cathedral. We were able to stroll along Fifth Avenue right up to Central Park (by the way would highly recommend the Boat House restaurant in the Park). We flew into Newark and the USA Coach Express left us at Bryant Park, just two streets from the hotel.
The hotel has a computer just off the lobby with internet access. This was really useful for us to check on our flight times, location of shops, etc.
In summary I would highly recommend The Iroquois as a small luxury hotel and look forward to returning some day. We has the perfect romantic break!
