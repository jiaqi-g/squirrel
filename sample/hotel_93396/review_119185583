We had a one night getaway without the kids with a flight to NY and a stay at the Iroquois Hotel. We've been there before a number of years ago. The hotel was beautiful and in a nice location next to the Algonquin.
We reserved the Deluxe Room (one above Superior) and it had about 300 square feet. It was a good sized room with a small bathroom and a superbly comfortable King size bed. We really wanted the king vs. the queen, but they wouldn't commit to that over the phone or when we arrived a bit earlier than check-in. They were friendly and professional at the check-in desk.
The porter Bill was great. He had a ton of information about the area and was very friendly and helpful. 
They have complimentary coffee/tea in the lobby area. There's a little sitting area called the library. The concierge can arrange just about anything such as show tickets or car service. It's a bit pricey, but you can get what you want.
They have an automated phone wake-up call. Although I got the confirmation that it was set for the right time it didn't actually work. We had a backup alarm set, so we were fine. There was a parade in the morning with the streets blocked off at 9am on Sunday. The hotel did give us a notice under the door, but earlier would have been more helpful. We didn't have a problem as we had a car that picked us up at 8am.
We didn't try the restaurant, but heard it was great. We had wine in the room that we brought. There was a wine opener and glasses. You can call zero for ice. They have 200 DVD's available to borrow, most with a NY theme available.
We'd definitely go back for the very nice room and fantastic bed.
