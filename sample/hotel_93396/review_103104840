enjoyed a four-night stay at this gem of a hotel in terrific location with wonderful staff...wonderful iva at the front desk welcomed us and was so helpful and friendly throughout our stay. alan was terrific at the concierge desk and went out of his way to assist us with maps, discussions, tips, and directions. on another day, vanessa at the concierge desk even gave us a card with her number in case we got lost or needed help. everyone went out of their way to make our stay lovely and attention to detail was evident throughout. housekeeping was spotless with turn-down service in the evening. we will recommend the iroquois to our friends and hope to stay there again!
