We came here on our honeymoon at the beginning of June 2011
we chose the Iroquois for it's location and reviews
We weren't disappointed
The staff are so friendly
we found they would go out of their way to help us
to give us suggestions on where to eat
giving directions and helping us with requests
The room wasn't huge
but what can you expect for central Manhattan? It was though very clean and luxurious
it was cleaned regularly
we received a daily weather forecast and chocolates along with a morning newspaper
The location was perfect for us
just off Fifth Avenue
great for shopping and easy access to Central Park
The Rockerfella Centre and the Empire State Building
Two blocks in the other direction lies Times square
a couple of minutes walk away
Close by are lots of coffee shops
as well as a Duane Reade
perfect for picking up last minute forgotten items
Behind the hotel lies Two Brothers Pizza
a slice of pizza for $1
We found nothing to complain about
we just hope we can save up enough money to come back here in a few years
Very happy customers
