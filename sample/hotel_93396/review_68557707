Had a lovely stay at the Iroquois recently
We asked for 2 double beded room and was upgraded to a suite
Service was second to none
Greeted by the lovely Bill and looked after by the even more lovely Nick
He was especially helpful and recommended some wonderful places to eat
The only downside was that the suite was actually a smoking room
which did smell initially
but you soon got used to it
The hotel itself
could do with a little updating and a duster wouldn't go a miss on the toilet lights
but thats just being picky
Complentary use of computer and printer was an excellent bonus
as was the free coffee in the morning
For a cheap and cheerful breakfast pop into the Red flame
just a few doors down
Also don't forget to tip EVERYBODY
We got told off on our return journey as we forgot to tip the door man
A wonderful
fabulous time had by all
definately stay again
