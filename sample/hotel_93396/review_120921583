We had a wonderful visit to the New York City Theatre District, topped off by a great hotel experience. The Iroquois is an 'old school' hotel, with a lovely ambience, right in the heart of the theatres, not far from Times Square, but surprisingly quiet (maybe because it was Sunday?)... Friendly service, from the doormen to the receptionist. We were told that our room was small, and was offered an upgrade (for a modest fee) but said we'd have a look first and let them know. It was quite small, but adequate for our needs, ie sleep. They even phoned the room to see if we were satisfied, which we were. It was clean and well stocked...
On our return from seeing Rock of Ages (fantastic, by the way) our bed had been turned down, choccies on the pillow, and new towels provided. In the morning, a complimentary NY Times was hung in a cloth bag outside the door. Moulton and Brown toiletries. Good shower/bath (just one thing, it started to go a bit cold near the end of my shower, but no biggy)...
In the morning. complimentary coffee in the lobby, then hot apple cider in the afternoon... both delicious. We checked out but left our bags for a few hours as we had time to explore a few more places before our train left Grand Central (very close and handy also). Nothing was too much trouble.
We didn't eat there, as the restaurant was closed for the Sunday night, but there were loads of places up and down W44th St...so not a problem at all.
All in all, a wonderful hotel (oh, and James Dean actually lived there for a while in the '50's!) We would definitely recommend it and would stay there again.
