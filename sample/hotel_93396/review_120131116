Stayed at this hotel twice in October and were very impressed
The staff in all departments were attentive and courteous
Nothing was ever too much trouble
We had interconnecting rooms which were very clean
Wifi was a bit weak in one room though
The room service breakfast was substantial and good value for money
My only negative comment would be the length of service in the Lantern cocktail bar
However
when served the martinis were excellent
The hotel is in an excellent location
close to theatres and shopping without being too noisy
We would definitely stay again
