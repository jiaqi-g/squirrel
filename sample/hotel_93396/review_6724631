We have just returned from 3 nights at the Iroquois Hotel
This is our fourth trip to New York in 6 months and we found this to be the best hotel we’ve stayed at so far
The location is great
near shopping
the museum mile
theatres (Broadway)
New York Library and Central Park
In the same block you also have two banks and opposite the hotel a parking garage
The rooms are cozy and attention has been paid to detail
The beds are soft and all rooms have wireless
It took a minute to figure out the shower
but the bathroom with Molten Brown products is clean and well proportioned
The staff was more than helpful
providing information on restaurants (and helping with bookings)
I would go back here in a heartbeat
We paid $239 per night for a room with a queen size bed – booked it via the internet
The only thing we found odd is that when our friends tried to book a similar room over the phone – they were given a more expensive room option – no mention of the $239 per night
Our friends phoned back to tell them that they were aware of a room with a queen size bed for $239
and were able to change their booking
