My stay at the Iroquois hotel was wonderful the staff was outrageous
We ate at the restaurant at the hotel the food was superb and the attention of wait staff was excellent
The hotel is small so they cater to their guests
The Iroquois hotel is centrally located to get to broadway shows and museums
The rooms are beautifully decorated with flat screen televisions and cozy linens on the beds
So all in all I recommend this hotel with at least a 5 star rating
