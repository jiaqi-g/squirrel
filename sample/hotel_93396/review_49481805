We decided to go to NYC at the last minute and did my research via Internet
The Iroquois was in our price range
right location and looked good
It turned out even better
Small intimate lobby with excellent free coffee in the mornings
The room was beautiful and spacious by NY standards and a fabulous marble bathroom
We were at the back overlooking an alley but hey it's NY and it was really quiet
Would definitely go back
