Conny and Nancy at the front desk along with the bell staff were extra nice
When we arrived they called within 5 min
to see if there was anything they could get for us
Our room was comfortable
clean
inviting
We especially loved the bed
The Frette linens were so comfy
All the things I dream about in Hotel rooms
We even had sunlight
That is a must for me
I just loved the service and the little extra amenities: ie
a movie list of DVD's to choose from for free
lemon ice water available all day
nice doormen
We just loved the small warm comfortable feel of this Hotel
I would recommend it anyone
