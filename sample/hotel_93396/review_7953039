From start to finish
our stay at the Iroquois was great
The room was large enough
very very clean
a staff that wanted to please you and a terrific location
of all the theatre district hotels i would rank casablanca and iroquois tied for #1
everyone else is a distant 3rd
will stay again and have told all of our friends to book here and to mention our name as you get rewarded for referals
