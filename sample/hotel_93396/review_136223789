We booked the hotel because we got a deal through Booking
com for a "Superior Queen" for about $200/night
When we arrived the room we were given was dark
on the fire escape and the bed looked far more like a double than a queen
We were able to upgrade to a room with a queen sized bed but had to pay a further $50 a night
The room was noisy which we expected because it was right on 44th and it was generally clean but really annoyingly the A/C (and heat) are centralised and controlled by the front desk
My wife was freezing in the room but the only way to control the temperature is to open and close the vents in the room so it was either stuffy because there was no air coming in or very cold
For the most part the staff were friendly and helpful (although one girl
in response to our comment that it was cold in the room did say my wife should just wear a sweater)
Still
we felt duped by the description of the room we originally booked and
for the price we ultimately paid
could have stayed in a nicer hotel
Overall
except for the staff's friendliness
we found little to recommend and we left disappointed
We would not go back
