I loved staying in this small Hotel with friendly understated service
The room was of a high standard with a great bathroom and downstairs there was a small but comfortable library which was a useful resource
with a pc for guests use
Located in W44th just off 5th avenue The Iroquois was only a walk from everywhere I needed to go
Perhaps the best feature was the outstanding small resteraunt in the Hotel but with its own entrance from the street
or access from the hotel lobby
Triomph
this not only had some of the best food I've eaten in a restaurant but also a good selection of well priced wines with a good choice availble by the glass
Again the service is friendly and understated
If you are going to New York on business or pleasure and want a quiet hotel to retreat to then I would recommend the Iroquois
My only criticism is I would have liked a kettle in the room
I'd rather make my own tea when I'm out of England
