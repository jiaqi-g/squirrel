Just returned from our weekend trip to NY
couldn't have been more pleased with our accomadations
We were lucky and got upgraded (are there sweeter words when you are checking in?) to a King Executive
so did not find the room small
Beautifully appointed
clean and so comfortable after hours in the city
The staff was attentive and pleasant
whatever requests we made were answered it seemed as we put the phone down
Did not eat dinner in the hotel
though had a drink at the bar before going out
Breakfast was sumptious
Lobby is under renovation
no problems
Will go back in a heartbeat
