I have traveled to different major destinations in the U
and abroad from Hong Kong to Freeport
Sydney to London
I have stayed in some of the nicest hotels in some desirable destinations
I have NEVER experienced a better concierge
Vanessa at the Iroquois blew my wife and I away
She went beyond the call of duty time after time
She was informative
friendly
professional
diligent and charming
She absolutely pulled off a miracle for me on our last day
finding a way to get us arrangements to get into the WTC Memorial
I changed our flights based on her efforts
From now on
our experiences with every future concierge will measured by you
Vanessa
