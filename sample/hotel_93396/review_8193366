My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for three nights in mid
The location
44th between 5th and 6th
is very convenient the theater while not being in the middle of the craziness of Times Square
Our deluxe room was suprisingly spacious
with a full closet and a large bathroom
We've stayed in several other NYC hotels in similar price range that had microscopic bathrooms
so this was a nice treat
The bed was comfortable and the towels and bathrobes were very plush
The lobby is quite small
but there is a nice library with free newspapers and a computer and printer (nice for printing boarding passes)
This hotel is a great value
Based on our experience with other hotels in New York City
this one is very reasonably priced
yet the rooms are upscale
