We were impressed by concierge Angelic who went to bat for us after a terrible dining experience at Nello's on Madison when we were charged $ 125
00 for a half order of truffle pasta
the special of the day
without being told the price when the most expensive item on the menu was around $40
We were naive and clearly marked
Angelic intervened and after several emails back and forth the manager returned 20% of the total bill to us
We had a great meal at Le Triomphe
however
with gourmet food
pleasant ambience and again good service
