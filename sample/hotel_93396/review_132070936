The location was great close to Grand Central
Bryant Park and Times Square
Friendly service from all the staff and especially from Bill
The room was quite comfortable
very quiet and kept clean
I would recommend a king bed as the queens size appeared to be smaller than usual queens
The toiletries were quality Molten Brown
There is free WiFi and the complimentary coffee in the morning
The complimentary overnight shoe shine was greatly appreciated
We had a perfect stay and would go back in a flash
