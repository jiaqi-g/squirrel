We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend and would definitely stay again
The location is central
close to subway lines
the train station and midtown addresses
Knowing the rooms were on the small side
we booked a king room
which looked into the courtyard through two windows
Everything was charming
staff were cheerful and helpful
and the bed was comfortable
Seemed like a unique hotel you would find off a street in Paris with the emphasis on quality and service
