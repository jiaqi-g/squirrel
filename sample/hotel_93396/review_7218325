We stayed at the Iroquois for 4 days at the start of a lengthy international vacation
We had never stayed there before but were immediately impressed by the way the staff rushed to accommodate our needs due to severe disruption caused by US Airways' usual incompetence
Rescheduling and rearranging check
in/out went incredibly smoothly with everything professionally handled by a very experienced and knowledgeable staff
The food is excellent
some of the best breakfasts and dinners we have ever had in over 30 years of travelling
Friendly
pleasant wait staff were eager to please and attend to our every request
An innovative menu made the servings sparkle with fresh ingredients and attention to preparation usually lacking in many NYC hotels
The hotel is well situated being convenient to both the theatre district
major department stores and mid
town Manhattan business venues
Rooms are fair
even large by New York standards
and are clean and well appointed
Linens and furniture are well above average and certainly qualify for a "luxurious" label
The housekeeping staff are attentive and work promptly and efficiently to respond to requests
The prices are extremely reasonable
even "best value for money" would be a fitting description
We'll stay here again at every opportunity
