My girlfriend and I picked the Iroquois for a romantic overnighter in NYC based on reviews and location
We were quite impressed from the moment we pulled up to the time we checked out
You couldnâ€™t ask for a more hospitable staff from the bell hops to the front desk to the maids
We felt so incredibly welcome throughout our brief stay
The hotel is impeccably clean and our suite was absolutely charming
I understand they have some type of noise proof glass which made our room virtually free of the noise and madness of NYC
We would recommend the hotel in a heartbeat
Great location
Great Staff
