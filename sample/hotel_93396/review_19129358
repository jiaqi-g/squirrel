Right upon arriving, I encountered the best thing possible: a free upgrade to a suite. Since I was travelling with just a friend, it could not have been more welcome. 
The place is sumptuous, the service is discreet, and for lovers of "boutique" hotels I can't imagine anything better. Of course the amenties are appropriate to this size of hotel, but overall they left nothing to be desired. 
If only I could be assured of an upgrade each time, I wouldn't stay anywhere else! But the prices will give pause to anyone who's paid in dollars.
