Although our room was small
it was very clean and very comfy
The staff were very nice
friendly and very helpful
I still remember one of staff members
he was very helpful
he took the time to explain everything to us
that made me feel very welcome
I am planning to go back there again soon
the hotel is really in the heart of everything
We were able to walk to most of our activities
you should visit this hotel
front desk staff like Alex and the door men will make you feel at home and very comfortable
