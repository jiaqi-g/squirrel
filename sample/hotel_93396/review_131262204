LOVELY staff! Everyone was so nice and very helpful. Great central location...quiet street. Room was small, but comfortable and very clean. Good linens and nice towels. Everything was very nice/comfortable/clean and made excellent by the hotel staff. They were great in helping us with whatever we wanted to do -- gave directions, hints on out of the way places, restaurant and show recommendations, etc. It was a WONDERFUL trip!
