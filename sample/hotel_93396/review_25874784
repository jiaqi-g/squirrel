Took my daughter to NYC for her 16th bday and I couldn't have been happier with this hotel
It is a small hotel but it is beautifully decorated
spotless
comfortable and they have the softest beds ever
The staff was wonderful
they were all very polite and accomodating
There is a diner right next door so you can get afforable breakfast/lunch and a drug store right around the corner
As if all that wasn't enough
the location of this hotel just can't be beat
Within easy walking distance of Bryant Park
Public Library
Rockerfeller Center
Times Square
Broadway
5th Avenue
I'll be recommending this hotel to all my friends and will stay here again on my next visit to NYC
