I chose this hotel for its proximity to Times square and Broadway and I am happy that I made the right decision as it turned out to be one of the nicest hotels in that area
My wife
her sister and our two kids stayed there for three nights and they enjoyed the room
the service and the proximity very much
As per my wife the concierge (Alan) did everything in his power and knowledge to help them around the city
I would definitely recommend this hotel to all others seeking a good hotel in the best area of NY
