I cannot think of a single flaw after staying 4 nights at the Iroquois
It was pretty much perfect in every way
It had character
charm
and history
Rooms were clean and luxurious
the beds were exceptionally comfortable
Location was perfect
The service was outstanding
Iva and John knew us by name after the first day and went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to ensure that we had an amazing trip
This was my 8th trip to New York and I can say hands down that this hotel was the best
I will definately be staying here next time I am in New York and I will be reccommending it to everyone I know
