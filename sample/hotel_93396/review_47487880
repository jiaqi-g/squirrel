My wife and I stayed at the Iroquois for our wedding anniversary recently and it is simply one of the best hotels we have stayed at. The hotel has an excellent location on 44th Street, between 5th & 6th Avenues and is convenient for all the major sights in the city. We had a deleux room fronting 44th which had all the mod-cons you would come to expect and was larger than we expected, having read that most hotel rooms in the city are on the small side (circa 200 sqft). The service was frindly, courteous and excellent throughout our stay. The conceige were both knowledgable and helpfully, helping us to secure bookings at 2 top restaurants. We didn't use the fitness centre or sauna, but both looked good. However, when it comes to finding a good restaurant, look no further than the Triomphe, which is part of the hotel. We dined here on our last night, opting for the 6 course tasting menu which was great value for money, and is without doubt, the best restauant we have ever eat in - and I say that having eaten in some top class restaurants. If you are looking for a modern, trendy hotel with swimming pool etc, then the Iroquois is not for you. But , if like us, you were looking for a boutique style elegant hotel with all the amenities you could want, then The Iroquois NY is the one for you. We will definately stay there again next time we visit New York.
