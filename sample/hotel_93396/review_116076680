We stayed at The Iroquois for four nights straddling 4 July this summer. The hotel is surrounded by bigger, morer famous (and maybe infamous?) hotels, such as the Algonquin and the Sofitel, and they are so popular because of a terrific location between 5th and 6th Avenue, which is so handy for so much of the city.
The hotel has a fairly small and restrained lobby, but staff are friendly and helpful. There are two PCs in a library just off the lobby, one of which seemed to be free just about all the time. There is a ready supply in the lobby of iced water with lemon or other fruit. which always hit the mark on those baking hot days we were in and out of the hotel.
Our rooms were on the 4th floor. They were clean and comfortable, though not particulary spcaious. They both looked out onto a fire escape, which made the rooms quiet, but also very gloomy. I guess that's normal in New York City, unless you have the funds for a high end hotel overlooking Central Park (I wish.....).
Just after we arrived, the lights in one of the rooms failed for some reason, but a call to reception brought forth the repairman, who was with us in less than two minutes - pretty impressive. He fixed the problem and it didn't recur.
The free wireless worked pretty well in one room, but was fairly weak in the other. The restaurant looked like it had an interesting menu, but was maybe a little pricey for our needs. Indeed, the breakfast option seemed very overpriced at $19 or $20, but there are other decent places within a few yards of the hotel, so never fear.
This was out first time in NYC (from over the pond) and my wife and I and our two kids (21 and 18) adored the city and appreciated the hotel and its qualities.
