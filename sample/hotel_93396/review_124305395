We read the reviews online looking for a hotel to stay in on our honeymoon in NYC
and we hit the jackpot with the Iroquois
The staff was excellent and very welcoming
The location was great
just off Times Square enough that it wasn't too hectic
It was close enough to all of the sites we wanted to see in that area
and only a few blocks from Grand Central which got us everywhere in the city we wanted to go
The room was of average size
but the bed was comfortable and was exactly what we were looking for after long days of walking around NYC
Having the fruit flavored water in the lobby was a huge plus after the extremely hot weather we encountered
Can't wait to come back on our next visit
