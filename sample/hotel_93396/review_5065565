our family spent four days in luxury at the iroquois, and could not have had a better experience. the service staff, concierge, and the general manager were congenial, extremely helpful, and made us feel that we were the only guests on the premises. i cannot wait to return to nyc, and would not consider any hotel than the iroquois.
