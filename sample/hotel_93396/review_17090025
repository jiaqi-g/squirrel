Made a last minute trip to NYC for a weekend
found the Iroquois Hotel via TripAdvisor
a great find
The staff was helpful
the room was spacious and comfortable
There was free computer access in a cozy library off the lobby
free NY Times for Sunday Morning and a nice big umbrella to borrow for the day when it started to rain
We could have eaten at the restaurant in the hotel
but instead went to a classic NY diner for a very reasonable Sunday breakfast right next door
Will definitely come again
