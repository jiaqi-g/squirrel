The Iroquois is superbly situated close to Times Square
yet was quiet and intimate and provided great comfort
The rooms
whilst New York sized were very nicely appointed
good linens
a comfortable bed and washroom with Molten Brown toiletries
The bar and library on the ground floor provided good places to hang
The staff could not have been more friendly or helpful
A perfect spot for a New York weekend
