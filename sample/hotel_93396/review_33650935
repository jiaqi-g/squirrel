Service was extra-ordinary at this hotel and we would highly recommend it. We stayed in a street view room with a king bed that was very clean and pleasant. Although there were some signs of "tiredness" in the furniture, it was still lovely.
Tip:If you wish to use the sauna - extra reminders are necessary.
