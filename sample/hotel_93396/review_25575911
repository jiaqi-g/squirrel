It's my pleasure to recommend to you the Iroquois Hotel in NYC. From the moment you arrive, the staff of this small wonder of a hotel goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The treatment my wife and I received is easily tops among hotels--there is a personal service element and approachability to it that exceeds your best expectations. Our room (a deluxe) was roomy by NY standards, perhaps smallish if you are elsewhere, but for us, it was cozy and romantic. The Iroquois is a great deal given the exceptional location (midtown, a block and a half from Times Square, but on a quiet, reserved block given to the subtle and elegant). Great bathroom with excellent shower, robes, etc. The hotel will shine your shoes, too, without fee, and do a great job of it. You get a comfortable bed with plush linens--it's little things like that which make this place special. The on-site restaurant is fine and recommended for both breakfast and meals later in the day, not to mention drinks if you are waiting on a flight. The staff always goes out of their way to make your stay perfect--why leave your hotel to chance when so much else about traveling is subject to change?
It's been said by others on this site that the Iroquois is like a home away from home. I concur. If you are like us you will miss this tranquil oasis when you leave, but you'll take fond memories of your stay. We just came back from our 2nd visit and look forward to visiting again.
