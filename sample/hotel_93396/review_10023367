stayed for two nights on business, appreciated the helpful front desk, high quality linens, bathrobe, marble tiles, chocolates on the pillow, and efficient air conditioning. pleasantly surprised to find that although my room was quite small, it had windows in the bedroom, bathroom, and closet. and it could not be in a more central location, beyond all of the attractions, if you're looking for a drugstore or food most hours of the day/evening, not to worry.
