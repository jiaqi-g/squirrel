A very nice hotel with great location
Close to theaters and Times Square and many great restaurants
Bus stop around the corner and close to the subway
Service
oriented staff
The room was not big but quite sufficient
The bed was the best we experienced on a vacation and the bedding was comfortable
The bathroom was very nice with a "mountain" of towels and wonderful products for shower and hair
More time was devoted to cleaning the bathrooms and smaller at turndown
Nice with chocolate on your pillow every night and a card with the next day's weather
Long waiting for the elevator
Recommended
