As this was our first trip to New York, we wanted to be close to the action but still have a quiet place to come back to after a day in the city. After some research, we decided to stay at the Iroquois. 
Knowing that hotel rooms are small in Manhattan, we opted to go for a Duluxe king room. As we had booked through a 3rd party, I called the hotel prior to arrival to check everything was fine, which it was!
On arrival we were greeted at the door and were welcomed by all members of staff. Although we arrived slightly early, the room was ready and we could go straight up. The room was clean and tidy and although not huge, was just fine for what we wanted. 
Vanessa ( the concierge) and Patrick at the front desk were extremely helpful and offered assistance where possible and would check on our return to the hotel of everything had gone well. 
The room was pretty quiet at night given we had a front facing room and the air con kept the room at a comfortable temperature even though it was 95-100 outside sometimes!
Would recommend this hotel to anyone!
