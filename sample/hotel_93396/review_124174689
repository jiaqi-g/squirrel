We finally found the perfect Times Square hotel! We have stayed at many different hotels in the area and this one was the best. The room was well-appointed and included a bath tub--a rare treasure for an NYC hotel! The bed was exceptionally comfortable, service was just superb, atmosphere was elegant yet warm, and the turn-down service was such a delightful touch. Also nice was that the elevators were efficient so there wasn't a lot of waiting or being crammed in. Highly recommended.
