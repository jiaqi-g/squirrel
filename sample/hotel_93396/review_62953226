You are no more than 20 minutes to any of the tourist hot spots, the location could not have been better. The other added advantage is the fact that the street is relatively quiet compared to some and as such you will get a great quiet nights sleep.
The rooms are cramped, even the exec kingsize felt more like a standard room, but everything was there that you would need.
Staff were friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Cant comment on the food as we ate out all the time, although the dining room didnt really make you want to dine there...small dark and gloomy...this would really be the only criticism of the hotel.
Otherwise it provided a fantastic base for a week long break.
