A college friend and I stayed at The Iroquois over Halloween weekend
It was the perfect place
Listed as a Small Luxury Hotel
it is central to many midtown attractions: Rockefeller Center
5th Avenue
Times Square
the Theatre District
Empire State Bldg
and we were able to walk to many of our midtown destinations
While the room was small (typical for midtown NYC)
it was clean
comfy and QUIET
The staff was very nice/helpful
After calling 10 other hotels
I had despaired of finding nice
reasonably priced accommodations for this busy weekend
The Iroquois was a happy surprise for us: we found this hotel was priced moderately
especially compared to its Hotel Row neighbors on 44th Street
and elegant in an understated way
The Iroquois is a gem of a classic NYC hotel
we will definitely come back
