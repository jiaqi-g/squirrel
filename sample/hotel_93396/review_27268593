Very plush traditional hotel. Very clean with polite staff. 3 minutes walk to Times Square. Lovely rooms, although ours was pretty small with a view onto a brick wall! Mini bar, large plasma telly with DVD player, really good bathroom. No tea making facils in the room which was a bit of a shame, but they did have them in reception. 
Overall a great hotel that I would recommend to anyone.
