I just returned from staying two nights at the Iroquois
I visit NYC about four times a year and use four
five star hotels
The Iroquois is definitely in this group
Nice touches from plasma screen TVs to excellent linens and toiletries
The staff was very attentive (less than 5 minutes for ice to be delivered to the room) and room service was quite prompt
Like most older hotels
the bottom
rate rooms are small ($309)
but fine for a single traveler
Overall
one of the best values in NYC
great location and a definite repeat
These guys try hard to please
