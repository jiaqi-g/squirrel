We stayed at the Iroquois in a one bedroom suite for five nights over easter
The suite was spacious & nicely decorated & very clean
The location is excellent
The staff were for the most part very pleasant
especially the cleaning staff
We had a number of irritating problems though
First on the day we arrived I had to call 3 times over a 5 hour period & speak in person to the front desk before someone brought up an extension cord for a machine that assists me breathe at night while I sleep
The cord should have come promptly after the first call
This is the only hotel in the world where I've had such a problem
Second
& maybe because it was Easter
the hotel seemed under staffed
70% of the time there were no doormen
The concierge was absent for a lot of our stay & made silly mistakes like booking 2 restaurants for the same night for us
We were called every evening to check if we wanted the sofa bed made up in the lounge room ? It seemed v odd
Breakfast in the room was very limited
essentially a continental breakfast
Room service after hours was not from an on site kitchen & was limited
The advised it would take an hour & they couldn't guarantee it would be warm ?
All room service including breakfast came with a $4 delivery charge plus 18% service
An incredible mark up
Also we could hear everything said & done in the room next to ours
there was a connecting door
luckily this was only in the lounge room of our suite but it is still strange when you're paying a lot of money for a suite to not get privacy
None of the problems were terrible but they were aggravating when added together
