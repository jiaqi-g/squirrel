We normally stay at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Time Square
but this time I wanted to stay in a smaller place with more charm
The Iroquois fit the bill perfectly
We stayed in an executive King room which was quite spacious for a New York room
The staff are very friendly and helpful
The location is perfect for walking to the theater
I would definitely stay here again if I wanted to be near Times Square
