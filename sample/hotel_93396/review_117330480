I've stayed in Manhattan many times and have never found a hotel that has it all
This came close but it wasn't perfect
I must admit
The hotel is quite unimpressive when you arrive
If you've been to the US before you will be used to an impressive lobby
usually that's where the money goes
There was no doorman and the lobby is dark
There are limited facilities but there is free coffee in the lobby and iced water and there is a PC available for for free internet access
It gets better once you get to your room
they are on the small side (but you are in a city) and the view is non
existent
well it was from our room anyway
However
I was travelling with my mother and I had a lot of problems finding a hotel room with two double beds in a luxury hotel that didn't cost the earth
This had them
with fab linen and Molton Brown toiletries
all at a very reasonable $350 inc tax per night over Easter weekend
The room would have been better if they'd removed the enormous office style chair that was stuck between the two beds
I'm really not sure why it was there
unless they expected the bedside table to double as a desk
Obviously they did
The closet was small
but we were only there for 2 nights so it didn't matter
The room had everything we needed and the welcome plate of free pastries and cookies was a nice touch
The location is the best thing though
just off 5th Ave and on a great block full of eating establishments
we were spoilt for choice and cancelled our pre
arranged reservations at Aquavit as a result
there is a fantastic Indian on this street
something of a rarity in NYC
I've spent years traipsing all over the city
I won't do that again
We got so much more out of our 3 days by staying in this location
We did pop into the Royalton over the road which I liked a lot
It wasn't my mother's style though
The Algonquin is also on the same street
it's been taken over by Marriott and I don't know what it's like but
again
the location couldn't be more highly recommended
Back to the Iroquois though
I dealt with the management over a booking error before I arrived and they couldn't be more helpful
This is a hotel that's trying hard and succeeding in the main
I would recommend it and would definitely consider another stay here in future
