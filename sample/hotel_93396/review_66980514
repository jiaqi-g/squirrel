The hotel seemed amazing from the moment we entered for my wifes 50th birthday suprise overnighter. The service at the front desk was wonderful. The location of the hotel to all the main midtown areas is just great. Our problem was that the air conditioning & humidity in our room could not be controlled and the room temperature would not drop below 72 degrees. Also the beautiful stone bathroom was simply gorgeous until you step into the shower and see the mold on the stone and in the shower door trim.
