My husband and I just spent 2 fabulous nights at the iroquois
Everything about our stay was great
The staff was friendly and attentive and very professional
Our deluxe room was SO comfy
the beds are really great
We loved the morning coffe in the lobby and the afternoon hot cider when we came to rest up for our evening plans
There is a computer to use with internet access in the cozy library in the lobby
The location is the best
especially for theatre
no cabs needed
We hope to visit again
One note
our room faced the street and sirens
etc were noisy
so maybe I'd ask for a room that didn't face the street
Did I mention the free shoe shine every night? It's a great place
so much nicer than those huge hotels
