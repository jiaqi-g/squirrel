We stayed here as a two night stopover at the beginning of a 7 month trip to Australia. The location was ideal, within walking distance of a lot of great places and easy access to transport links. We loved New York and didn't actually end up spending much time in the hotel, which was a shame as the room was lovely. We didn't end up trying the breakfast, however we did eat in the Triomphe one night and very much enjoyed it.
The room was expensive, but only when comparing to other locations; within New York and in the location it was, it provided good value for money. This was our second stay in a SLH hotel, both have been fantastic, we will certainly be looking for more of their hotels in future, wherever we are going!
