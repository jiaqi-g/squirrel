My Mom and I stayed at the Iroquois for 3 nights in mid February 2010
The staff at the Iroquois are very friendly and the service was fabulous
The rooms were spotless and the hotel was very quiet
The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on
It was amazing
The french toast was the very best as well
We both loved New York and would stay at the Iroquois again if we go back
I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling there
