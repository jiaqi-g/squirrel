I share in all the other wonderful reviews of this hotel. The concierge staff is five star as was all the staff we interacted with -- well trained and very attentive. They arranged excellent transportation for us to and from airport. We stayed in a King Executive room and while it was the size of most hotel rooms it was more than adequate for our needs -- nice sized closet, wall mount television, marble bath, big desk. Free wireless (why oh why doesn't every hotel have this!) excellent bed and bedding, great breakfast and the best location. Wonderful restaurants within easy walking distance -- best one is the hotel's Triomphe. Husband's conference at the Mariott on Times Square (will never stay there again) so easy walk for him. 
Only complaint was in the bath -- it was very cold during our stay and the bathroom seemed to never warm up -- wish they would have installed radiant heat in the floors when they redid the bath. But that minor complaint (and it really wasn't too uncomfortable once you ran a hot shower) and some painting they did on an elevator while we were there that had incredibly strong odors are the only negatives associated with our stay . They definitely will not keep us from returning!
