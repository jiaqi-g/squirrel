Nice size rooms, clean, very friendly staff, HOWEVER ... two of the four nights we were there, the A/C didn't work. When I reported it to the front desk, they just said "Yes, we knew it was out". Ummm, what? They said it would be fixed the next night, but the next night was just as hot. When we checked out and again reported the problem, she said "Did you alert the front desk" to which we said yes. And that was it, no mention of a discount, no apologies! I am disappointed because I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, even despite the great location, I will not be staying here again. No one likes to sweat while they sleep!
