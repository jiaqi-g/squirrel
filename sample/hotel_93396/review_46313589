My 3rd trip to the Iroquois
and it's always a pleasure
The lobby was recently redone and is sophisticated without being pretentious
The room was a good size and nicely appointed
And the staff couldn't do enough to please us
All in all
recommended
particularly for those who appreciate a small European type hotel and ambiance
