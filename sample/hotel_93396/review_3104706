I recently hosted a 95th Birthday party for my grandfather at the Iroquois and its fantastic restaurant Triomphe. Our guests literally ranged from 3 to 95 years old, and the hotel was a great fit for all. The staff were totally accomodating about everything we needed and the many extra touches only enhanced our experience. From the junior Frette robes for my little nieces to the complimentary bottles of wine for the more mature guests, they provided all the necessities for a memorable family weekend. And the comfortableness of the beds at the Iroquois will now be a recurring topic of conversation among my family!
And the dinner far exceeded our expectations! The food is outstanding, and truly stands out in a city known for great restaurants. All the guests were surprised by just how good the meal was. My family (a food loving one!) will be talking about the apple caramel bread pudding for some time... but only after it's done talking about the scallops appetizer with foie gras and porcini mushrooms. And I'd confidently put the filet mignon up against any I've ever had. Each bite was a distinct enjoyment. 
My family comes to NY quite a bit, and I know they'll always first consider the Iroquois when looking for a hotel. Most importantly, my grandfather loved it all. He stayed there Saturday as well (even though he lives on the Upper Eastside). As a lifelong New Yorker who has experienced it all in this city (including storied business lunches at the Algonquin), Pop had never heard of the Iroquois or Triomphe. But since then, he's been raving about both and smiles widely when talking about the weekend. He keeps saying, "We have to go back to Triomphe for dinner!" 
For the convenience offered, the comfort of the rooms, the attentive staff, the amazing food, the luxurious but homey decor, the excellent value... you will not find a better hotel in NY City.
