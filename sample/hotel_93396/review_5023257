After reading Trip Advisor reviews regarding this property along with the affordable price
we decided to give this property a chance
It was the real deal and I thoroughly enjoyed everything about the property
I have traveled to NYC several times and this is the best property I have stayed at
especially considering the price
Ask for room 1200
it has a great view of the Chrysler building
