My stay was outstanding
I had requested a room with a view of the Chrysler building and even though they couldn't promise anything
they got it done
I ran out of toothpaste and they delivered a new tube
In the evening
I requested a table at Triomphe
and the concierge made it happen by reserving a corner table by the door in the bar
a really nice spot
It was raining when we left for the theater and they gave us umbrellas
Tremendous service
I won't hesitate to stay there again
hopefully soon
