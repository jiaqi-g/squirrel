We chose the Iroquois after much research on the Trip Advisor
Having stayed in New York a couple of times before I knew that some of the hotels can be very poor with small rooms
The Iroquois is nothing like that
great staff as soon as you enter
on the doors and on reception
always welcoming and helpful
Our room was on the 8th floor and was a nice size with a really comfortable bed
Room was of a wall which was a little disappointing but not unusual for NYC
Only let downs was the construction on the lifts with drlling noise (during the day when we were out anyway) and the constant noise in the room from what I can only discribe as a constant air con noise (even though I had that turned off) and pipe noises every so often from the bathroom
Sleeping wasn't great for me as these noises kept waking me up
You do soon get used to it and was only minor
Location is amazing close to 5th Av
Grand Central and Times Square
really easy to get around
Would stay here again
Only request in the future would be to have a small breakfast included maybe
