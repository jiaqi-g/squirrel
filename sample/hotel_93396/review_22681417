I booked this trip last minute
I was greeted by Bill who was great
He was the start of a great trip
Bill greated us with a smile and also assisted my wife and made sure she was comfortable
After being in traffic for two hours
he really made us relax
This hotel was very quiet and comfortable
The rooms were clean and the staff helpful and pleasant
I will go back
Short and to the point
all around good place
