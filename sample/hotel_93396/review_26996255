This was our second stay at the Iroquois, and we could not have been more pleased. Our suite was spacious, comfortable, and clean. The staff were gracious and friendly, and the location is perfect -- close enough to Times Square (but not too close), Fifth Avenue, and bus and metro stops. We will be back.
