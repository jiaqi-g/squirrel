I can understand why this hotel is ranked so highly. It feels like (and is) a small hotel in the heart of the big city. The rooms are small, yes, but in a good way. The rooms are also clean, and well appointed with premium linens and bath products. The staff were universally courteous (a rare thing in New York) and standing by to help at all times. I liked the small library off the lobby, and the Lanterns Keep cocktail bar is a real find. I would go there even if I wasn't staying in the hotel.
I paid $170 a night in the week before Christmas, and I understand this hotel is more like $300 in busier times of the year. But even at $300, this hotel would be worth the money if you are choosing between it and a Hilton, Hyatt, Westin, etc.
