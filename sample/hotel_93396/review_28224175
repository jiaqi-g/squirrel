I would definitely stay in the Iroquois again. The location is great, the rooms are spacious for NYC and the beds are extremely comfortable. The hotel is very nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. Stayed for 4 nights over the busy Easter weekend but the hotel was quiet, calm and relaxing. The staff were all very helpful and whilst we didn't have time to try the hotel restaurant the menu was very good.
