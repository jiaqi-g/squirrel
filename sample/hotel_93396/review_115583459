My daughter and I met up with some family for a NY vacation. We stayed 4 nights and the Iroquois experience was fantastic. We were met by a wonderful bellman, John, had smooth and friendly check in and escorted to our exceptionally clean and comfortable room. Both concierges, Vanessa and Alan, were of great help and always friendly and accomodating. Loved the bath products and linens, beds very comfortable, nice to have a DVD player and IPOD dock in the room. Chocolates on the pillow every night a nice touch. This hotel is close to everything yet far enough that it was peaceful and quiet at night. Airconditioning worked great as did Internet access. The Iroquois staff clearly went out of their way to make sure our stay was pleasant and comfortable. If I ever get back to New York I will definitely stay here and I will recommend this hotel to all of my friends. Staying at the Iroquois was a fantastic choice and I cannot imagine anyone would be disappointed here.
