Have just returned from a weeks stay (previously stayed last year) everything was as we remembered
all the staff are friendly and helpful
rooms are comfortable and are large enough
contrary to what others say
they are well appointed
the bathroom was large
clean and lots of fluffy towels and Molton Brown showers gels etc
The hotel is in a perfect location and whilst I agree the views are not excellent we did not go to sit and look out of the windows all day
if that is what you want pay double and have a room in a hotel overlooking Central Park
Go to this hotel if you want to have the personal touch and actually feel welcomed
