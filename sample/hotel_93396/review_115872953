We stayed at the Iroquois during the hottest weekend in July. The jar of iced citrus water at the door was the perfect introduction to the guest-focused service that makes this hotel so great. The location of the hotel could not be better, right in the heart of midtown Manhattan. 
The staff was very helpful and patiently answered all our questions.
