What an incrediblly pleasant surprise! I discovered the Iroquois on line and decided to stay there with my daughter, her three children and myself . They had a wonderful set-up: a small living room with a bedroom and bath on either side. The rooms were beautiflly done: Plasma tvs, fine bath fixtures ( I'm ordering the same toilet for my bathroom) fine linens plus great help.
This hotel is near ToysrUs, DB's great restaurant, and convenient to the theatre district-a real diamond-concierge,etc terrific!!!
