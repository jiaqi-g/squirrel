My husband and I stayed here for 1 night this past weekend
The staff at the front desk were unprofessional and rude
We pre
arranged an upgraded room
and at our arrival we were unpleasantly told that it was not possible
we were then escorted to a tiny room across from the elevator
We finally ended up on a smoking floor with a view of pigeon droppings and a fire escape
the staff were not helpful in getting a cab or opening the door when it was 12 degrees outside
we had to walk 3 blocks to find one
Bottom line
stay somewhere else
unless you don't mind being treated poorly and sleeping in a closet
