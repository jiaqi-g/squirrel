Wonderful charming hotel
The location is perfect
Walking distance from such numerous highlights in New York City
Grand Central
TImes Square
Empire State Building
Rockefeller Center
Bryant Park
New York Public Library
just to name a few
But should your prefer to use the subway
you have both the Bryant Park/42 street station and the Grand Central station that give access to some of the main lines
And if you're a walking addict as we are
you can reach most of downtown and midtown Manhattan by foot
The staff was all to friendly starting from the Front Desk through the Concierge
the Porters and the Room Maids
If you're fan of those undifferentiated rooms that one can find in those big hotel chains
then this hotel isn't for you
But if you're looking for a place you can call "Home away from Home"
then this hotel is definitely it
We've heard of it in the web site of "Small Luxury Hotels of The World" (www
com) and it met all our expectations
Would recommend it for sure and hope to return to it soon
