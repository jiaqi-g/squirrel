I would agree with that
although good
the Iroquois was not quite as good as I had expected
particularly for the price paid
The lobby is still under major renovations
and again this was not mentioned when I booked or apologised for
Service from front desk was efficient but not very warm
I was reluctant to go back for further information as it felt like you were bothering them at times
Given this is a Small Luxury Hotel
I would have expected more
The room and bathroom were small
but fine
certainly by European standards
I very much liked the decor and fittings
and the bed was extremely comfortable
We had an 8th floor room with absolutly no view (a brick wall) and very noisy generators outside
We're not particularly bothered by noise
but this was quite noticeable
Given that the stay cost approx Â£250 per night per room (and of course there's no breakfast included in that) this was an expensive hotel
and I certainly wouldn't call it value for money
but I'm not sure that that isn't typical of most NYC hotels
