We arrived at the hotel off the back of a 7 night stay in a Vegas suite and to say the constrast was a shock to the system would be an understatement
When we arrived we were greeted by a reception area that was in the middle of being refurbished (the hotel conveniently managed to omit this during any booking conversation)
First impressions count and needless to say this did not help one bit
The check
in was smooth and the staff friendly and our next experience was the antique elevators
very slow
very dated and very tired
Then the room
whilst it was tidy and clean the decor was also tired but the overwhelming lasting impression is the size
or lack of as the case may be
The bed dominates the room with just enough space to walk around and there was certainly not enough cupboard space to accomodate my wife and my self never mind store any bags/cases out of the way
Now I do not claim to be an experienced New York visitor and I was aware that hotel rooms in midtown Manhattan are small but was not prepared for just how small
We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking 44th streat which was a bonus as I think that if we had been given a room at the back facing a brick wall or AC unit I would have turned around and walked out
The bathroom was reasonably well appointed with everything that you would expect
The room was furnished with most of the conveniences that you would expect from a deluxe/superior room; safe
iron/board
wifi internet access
wide screen TV etc but did not have any tea/coffee making facilities
? The room was serviced well with no complaints on that front
The hotel has a bar/restaurant called Triomphe attached and whilst the bar was small and friendly the food wasn't great by NY standards
Overall the biggest positive that this hotel has is the location
It's situated on West 44th between 5th and 6th Avenues and is a stones throw from some of the main NY attractions
However the hotel advertises itself as a boutique hotel with the obvious French theme and states 4 star rating and an entry on the Small Luxury Hotels of the world
At one point in time this may have been the case but unfortunately not now
The decor was old and tired and the boutique theme lost somewhere in translation
It tries hard with Molten Brown products in the bathroom and decent towels and linen but doesn't really come up to scratch I'm afraid
Certainly not for the prices they are charging
I don't have any major complaints about the hotel but there is definately better value for money even on the same street as the hotel is located directly next to the Sofitel and straight across the road from the Royalton which both looked more spacious and better appointed
Whilst we enjoyed our time in NY it's unlikely that we'll stay here in future
