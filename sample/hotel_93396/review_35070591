Stayed there with my husband and 9 year old daughter
We got married while we were out there
Couldn't fault the location and would only stay there again based on that
Rooms were clean but felt the service was below standard
The bell boys and cleaners were really friendly but the reception staff sometimes weren't very much so
Got quite excited hearing about peoples free upgrades and complimentary bottles of wine for birthday etc
but we got nothing
not even a smile whilst waiting for our limo to take us to our wedding ceremony
Rest of the wedding party had to wait two hours when they checked in as their rooms weren't ready and had to wait an hour for some ice
and that only arrived after two more calls down to reception
The room manual said that children get a bubble bath of their choice and a tote bag with colouring things in but we never got either
even though we asked reception twice
As I said
we'd only stayed there again because of the location and if a good deal came up
You don't spend a lot of time in your room to be honest
On a positive
it was nice and quiet
we got some cookies in our room for 2 days in a row and the choccies were nice
