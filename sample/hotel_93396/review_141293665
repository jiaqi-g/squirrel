This hotel is located in the very centre of midtown manhattan
(44th between 5th and 6th ave)
As such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District
If you don't mind the walk
Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over)
We however
found that many of the places we wanted to visit
required a short cab ride (Chelsea
West Village
Lincoln Center)
Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive
plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days
If you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life
this area is to be avoided
If you enjoy hustle and bustle
the centre of the action is right here
Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel
if you are at the front of the building
you need to be high up
We stayed in two different rooms
The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor
it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room
This room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out
The decor however
was extremely nice
We extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor
This consisted of a lounge with two sofas
a desk and two armchairs
a chest of drawers
some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge
Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed
plus an armchair with footstool
a chaise long style bench
a chest of drawers
a couple of tables and another large TV
Also a very thin closet
The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes
We loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in
I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house
One major drawback for us
was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms
At some point in the past
the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room
leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps
picture spots etc)
At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting
In our first room
we asked for an extra lamp
which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs
so not a complete solution
The service in this hotel was excellent
Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff
This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations
Other small but nice features of this hotel
are the switches on the back of the door
which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green
so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service
The library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers
plus computers with internet
There is also free and speedy wifi throughout the hotel
We would definitely stay again if we needed a comfortable bed in midtown again
