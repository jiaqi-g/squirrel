I just spent three nights at The Iroquois and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel
The location is great and the hotel itself is very clean and well maintained
the rooms are a bit small and mine had a view of an alleyway
however
that isn't much different than most New York hotels
The sauna wasn't working well when I was there
however
the staff was attentive to the problem and got the situation worked out
The beds are very comfortable and the flatscreen television worked well
The free WiFi helped me get over the jetlag
I recommend the Iroquois
