This word best describes our stay at this hotel, from the moment we stepped out of our car to our all too soon checkout. The staff is always available should you need any help or information. The icing on the cake was Thanksgiving dinner at the Triomphe Restaurant that was completely over the top. I guess you already know that we will be staying here again on our next visit to New York. Thanks for a great vacation experience.
