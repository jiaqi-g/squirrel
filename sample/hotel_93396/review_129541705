Hotel with an excellent location (very very close to times square)
The room (601) was very clean
comfortable and no noisy (I slept well)
staff was friendly
mainly Sergio and Anowar
If you need informations
don't hesitate to ask to Sergio the concierge
he will give you plenty informations (maps
reductions for some visit like the empire state building and the Intrepid
supermarket address
I've very appreciated the fitness room with professional equipments
Don't hesitate
to choose this hotel you will not be disappointed
Another advice is to take comfortable shoes (even running shoes)
in Manhattan on the map all seems close but when you walk it's not really the case
