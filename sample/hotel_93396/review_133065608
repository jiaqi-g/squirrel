We stayed at The Iroquois this month for 4 nights as a group of three women on a New York adventure
We found the location ideal
just a few blocks from Times Square
The staff including door man Bill were so helpful and friendly giving us great advice including where to shop for groceries and where to find the best New York cheesecake
The room had 2 comfortable queen beds and had enough room and all the modern conveniences
Although small the bathroom was modern and provided for our needs
After long days of sightseeing we took advantage of the free DVD rental on a couple of occasions
Although we didn't eat in at the restaurant there were plenty of affordable meal options nearby to suit every taste and budget
I would highly recommend this hotel as a comfortable
stylish and affordable stay
