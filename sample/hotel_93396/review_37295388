General Manager Scott and his professional staff uphold the type of New York Class you expect in this great city. nothing is left out. this is the type of old new york charm you love this city for. you want sheeky and cheesy go to Miami. you want classy and comfortable go to the Iroquois!! one block from Times Square, but you wouldnt know it, the street is very quiet and is tree lined. this location is an obviously great jumping point to whatever NYC excursion or attraction you choose to do. the concierge will take care of it all, but the best part about this hotel is the general manager himself takes an interest in seeing that your stay is perfect. he doesnt just hide behind the curtain until you have a problem like other hotels. the price is very competitive. Definately recomend for business or leisure.
