All the reviews say it, but just to reiterate the location of this hotel is fantastic. Nestled between 5th and 6th Avenue, all the city has to offer is a short step away but without the hustle and bustle of Times Square. Room was surprisingly spacious, zero outside noise, (the view of the fire escape was uninspiring but you don't go to NY to look out of a window) , chocolates on the pillow were a nice touch. Bed's were like sleeping on clouds and power shower wakes you up in the morning. Would definitely stay again with family or friends and have already recommended it.
