We stayed for one night in a deluxe room; we were in town to visit an exhibit at MoMA
in easy walking distance
Pros:
Nice
clean room in good shape w/ contemporary decor
The "Library" lounge on the ground floor was great for checking email
Free coffee in the AM
The staff was helpful and friendly
Very central midtown location near Grand Central / Penn Station
There are some nice hotel bars on the street
Cons:
Our window looked out into air conditioning equipment
The room was also pretty small; not surprising in NYC but still disappointing for a deluxe room
We didn't receive our complimentary NY Times
no big deal
