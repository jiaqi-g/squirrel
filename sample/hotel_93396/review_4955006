I have just returned from a quick visit to NYC
I found my stay at the Iroquois to be the highlight of my trip
The small
quaint size makes it a nice home while visiting bustling Manhattan
I was pleasantly surprised to find my room ready to check in at 11:00 a
after I had flown all night from L
The comfy beds and exceptional shower were just what I needed to recharge
Although small
the room was so comfortable that I overslept and missed some prime sightseeing time
The next day I got smart and used the wake up service
The location made it perfect for theatre goers like me
The Iroquois rooms were immaculate and the service was very accomodating
The staff was very helpful when I needed to store my luggage on my last day since I had a late flight back to California
