I am from Germany and I just returned from a wonderful trip to New York
a few days ago
I stayed at this lovely hotel "Iroquois" for 5 nights at the end of february and I absolutely loved it
Each and every staffmember is very caring and attentive and they try to fulfil every wish you have
The rooms are very nicely decorated
The beds are the most comfortable ones
I have ever slept in and it was hard to get up in the morning
I loved the shower
it has such a great pressure and it really wakes you up
Even though
I did not really have time to watch TV
I loved the flatscreen TV in the room
The hotel restaurant "Triomphe" is amazing and has the best food ever
The Frenchtoast in the morning is great
everybody should try it
I have never tasted a better one
The location is perfect
right in midtown next to Timessquare and the shopping district on 5th Avenue
The Concierge can provide you with details about where to go and what to see
They gave me great tips
This hotel is definately worth its money and I would absolutely stay there again
