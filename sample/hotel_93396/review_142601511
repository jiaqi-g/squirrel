My husband and another couple went to NYC for a 4 day weekend birthday trip
We chose the Iroquois and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel
The location was perfectly central for shopping
dinners
broadway and the subway
The room was a good size for NY and clean
The staff was better than THE BEST
The concierge
was unbelievable
He got us into amazing restaurants at perfect times
He got us fantastic tickets to a great play
Gave us perfect directs and made great suggestions
He pulled off an amazing feat for my birthday by having a flowers sent to a trendy restaurant and on the table with wine chilling with the best table in the place
Both he and Bill our Bellhop
not only made great after dinner ounce recommendations but they got us on the guest list and we didn't have to wait despite huge line ups
They literally made the trip for us and will always be thought of and spoken of when we reminisce
The rest of the staff was very good as well
Bottom Line
we would stay again and recommend it to others
Thank you
