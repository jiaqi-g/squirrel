My daughter and I were in New york for business, but it was also Mother's day weekend. We stayed at the Iroquois for the first time, but not the last .The staff was great, especially Rocky andJ.J. ..they made us feel special and at home. The restaurant was fabulous. We had the chefs sampler menu..try it. Breakfast in bed the next morning yielded wonders, croissants and fresh fruit..great coffee . Our room was quiet and I wanted to take the bed home. Actually I wanted to take the hotel home. Kristen Walter Dukes
