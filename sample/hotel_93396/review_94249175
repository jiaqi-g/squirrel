My 12 year-old daughter and I returned to the Iroquois for our 2nd annual mother/daughter weekend, and had a wonderful time. You couldn't ask for a more friendly and helpful staff! Upon arrival we were informed that they selected a larger room for us knowing that we weren't 100% thrilled with our smaller room last year. The concierge was wonderful! I sent an email a week before our arrival asking for suggestions on places to visit and information on where to find my daughter's favorite ice cream. He responded within 12 hours and even followed up with more suggestions a day later. The doormen were always smiling when we ran into or out from the cold, and offering to get us transportation or sending us off in the correct direction when hoofing it down the street. Yes, the rooms are boutique in size, but they are spotless and the bedding is luxurious. My 12 year-old did not want to leave the cozy bed with it comforter and huge pillows. Location is awesome, easy to get to everything! As for price, it allowed this mom/daughter to enjoy NYC without breaking the bank. Coming back next year!!!
