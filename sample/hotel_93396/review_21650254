This is a real time review of this hotel
The day started relatively promising
I arrived on a redeye flight at 6am at the hotel
and the night receptionist was extremely friendly
saying that although there were no rooms available
he would expedite my request
Unfortunately
he was the only friendly staff member at the front desk and the experience has become increasingly frustrating from that point forward
The night receptionist handed my request to the daytime receptionist
and that's where any form of concerned customer service stopped
Now there is no sense of urgency
and the receptionists basically are telling me that I just have to wait until someone checks out
No one seems to want to resolve this issue
so here I am left posting a negative review
This is a disaster
I usually trust the TripAdvisor ratings and book all my hotels based on reviews posted on this site
This is not the case for this hotel and appears to be an abberation of it's #15 ranking in the New York City area
