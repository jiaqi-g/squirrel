Before the school year began
I wanted my 10
old daughter to have her first visit to NYC
I had spent a lot of time on the web trying to find just the right hotel and picked The Iroquois
We spent four days (3 nights) and it turned out to be a great choice
The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful
We had taken a red
eye flight in from the west
Since a room was available
they let us check
in in early
We unpacked then set out for our first walk around Manhattan
When we came back to the room
they had replaced one of their regular fine bathrobes with a small size one for my daughter
That is the kind of special attention we got during our entire stay
Their concierge was knowledgeable and seemed very objective
She listened to our interests and didn't appear to be pushing any particular places or tours (unlike some I've found in other hotels)
The rooms are typical NYC size
but very nice
The wall
mounted
flat screen TV was great
It was one of only a few nice hotels where I could find two large queen size beds
The location
between Broadway & 5th Ave
couldn't have been better for our trip of sightseeing
plays and shopping
It was a wonderful father/daughter experience
and the Iroquois was a ideal setting
I'll certainly go back on a personal or a business trip
