I have just been staying at the Iroquois
Just when I entered the sweet smell hit me which i am always associating with a cheap cleaning product (which it probably was) and I thought I was in the wrong hotell
The lobby although apparently just extensively renovated (what I read on tripadvisor) is dull and not welcoming
The rooms were pleasantely nice in comparison
some small but ok
What i really did not like was the service
it was just the bare minimum
I always had the feeling that they were happy when I did not ask them too much
On Sundays the restaurant was closed and there was only a very small menu with Hamburgers etc
For these kind of prices i don't think this is acceptable
In the whole i did not like the atmosphere of the hotel at all and will certainly not stay there again
