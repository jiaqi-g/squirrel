The location of this hotel is perfect. Walking distance from Times Square, the theaters, great restaurants, and the subway. Everyone at the hotel was so helpful. Our only problem was slow elevators, but that just gives you time to get to know others waiting.
Our room was a bit small, but very comfortable with great pillows and comforters I'd highly recommend this hotel
