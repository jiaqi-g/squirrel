If you like the huge crowdy hotels
this one is not for you
If you wanted a boutique luxury hotels in the best location of Manhattan
just off Times Square
you've got it
The service is incredibly great
starting with the front desk
the concierge
and even the technician who helped me with the Wi Fi
The room has anything you need with Molton Brown amenities
The fitness room has just everything
and I heard their Triumph restaurant is awesome
though I haven't tried it
It is just THE hotel for NYC
