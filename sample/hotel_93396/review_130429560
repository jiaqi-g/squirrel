Spent a weekend in NYC with a buddy of mine
Picked this hotel due to it's location and great reviews on tripadvisor
The location is incredible
Did a lot of walking but was able to get everywhere for 4 days without using any public transportation
A few places worth mentioning:
Madison Square Garden
Times Square/Broadway
Central Park
Empire State
all within walking distance
Hotel staff was great and very helpful
Room itself was pretty small and but very clean
I'm used to a lot of AC thus it felt a bit warm at night but the staff helped me out there too by providing a table fan
Overall I would recommend this place to any single/couple but families might want to get a place with larger rooms
