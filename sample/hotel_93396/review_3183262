I recently spent a total of 7 nights at The Iroquois Hotel
Even the "luxury" rooms are VERY small
Carpets and upholstery spotted
furniture not in the best condition
disappointing and certainly NOT for a standard for a member of the "Small Luxury Hotels" group
Reservations department refused to make good on a Guest Referal Program they "offer"
attentive staff at the hotel bar
There are lots of better places to stay in New York
