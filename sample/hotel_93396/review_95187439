I stayed here on Jan 29th, 2011 and I can tell you for sure that I will back at this Hotel. The staff is amazing from Rocky and Eddie who greet you at the door right up to Erin who serves you with a smile at the Bar. This is literally the most Central location you could pick for any evening in Manhattan. On the ride to the hotel, you pass right by all of the major shows and classic Broadway settings. Then you arrive and are greeted by one of the friendliest doormen in the city. You walk into a great classic NY lobby, with beautiful marble floors and fantastic dark wood trim everywhere. There is even an extremely inviting library right in the lobby, as I was a bit pressed for time I did not get to fully check it out, but will be enjoying a cup of coffee or a cocktail there upon my next stay for sure. The rooms were immaculate with a personal note from the management waiting for us. All in all, I can't think of one thing to complain about, except maybe for the cold weather. Oh and the elevator located in the back of the lobby is faster than the one located in the front. I can't wait to plan another evening in the city and stay at the Iroquois.
