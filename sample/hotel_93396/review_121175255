I stayed at The Iroquois for 3 weeks while on a business trip. The hotel staff goes out of their way to make you feel comfortable. The rooms are clean and decorated in a very traditional decor' as in marble floors and gold trim. The bed is super comfortable. Rooms are a bit small, but it's NY. This hotel is within walking distance to Times Square, Grand Central Station, and Rockefeller Center. The hotel is on 44th, which is quiet, so after a long day you can get some sleep. They are also across the street from Gregory's, which has good coffee and pastries. What I liked most about this hotel is that it's not busy so you feel very comfortable and at home. The gym has the basics and there is a small sauna which is nice. Food at their restaurant is really good, but a little pricey. Their bar is nice too because it's not busy. Their bartender Alex is awesome! Downside, they offer laundry services, but it is expensive!
