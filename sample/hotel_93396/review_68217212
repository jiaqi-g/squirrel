I usually won't stay at a hotel this expensive (even for NYC) but I was in the city for work, with little flexibility around dates/location. it was almost completely worth it. I was upgraded to a suite, great service, friendly front desk and even the room service dinner was very good. I prefer smaller hotels in general, so this was perfect for me.
I would definitely stay here again - just not on my own dime. I've stayed in NYC hotels that were much less expensive, and almost as good.
