I have stayed at the Iroquois twice in the past few months. It's a quaint hotel right off 5th. The rooms are small but so are all hotel rooms in NYC. The front desk staff was very nice. There is a cute diner for breakfast if you walk out the door of the hotel, make a right, it's right on their corner. Both rooms I stayed in were clean. They have a nice sitting area in the lobby if you need to meet people, get a boarding pass, or just kill some time. I like this hotel and will be back again soon!
