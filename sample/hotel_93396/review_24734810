Where to begin, The place is beautiful.. When we walked in there were honey covered blueberries and they were fabulous. The beds are the most comfortable beds, I ever slept in..The service were very friendly and not stuck up, as I thought manhattan would be..overall the people went out of there way to make us feel at home..
