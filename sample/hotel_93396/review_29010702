We had a 5 night stay at the Iroquois and had initially booked a Queen room. However, upon arrival I (perhaps cheekily!) asked if we could be upgraded and we got a King room for an extra $30 a night (which was well worth it). The staff at the hotel were all excellent, from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man to the door man, all very polite and helpful (which is NOT the norm for New York!!). The room itself was nice and spacious, good sized flat screen TV, very comfortable king sized bed, good sized bathroom, all very clean. The view not so great but was still quite light. 
Two things made me realise this hotel was brilliant. The first was when room service delivered a free bottle of wine to our room as it was my girlfriend's birthday (which I had mentioned on check in). The second was one night when my other half and I came back and we'd stopped at a little place to get a cup of tea to take back. When we got back there was no tea bag in the cup, just hot water and milk!! So I went down to reception and the lady there was all too apologetic even though it wasn't from the hotel! She then went and got us a couple of tea bags for no charge, bless her!
Overall this was a very, very pleasant stay. The location is fantastic, literally 1 and a half blocks from Times Square and half a block from 5th Avenue. We didn't have any food there (it was a tad pricey) but it all looked pretty good. There was also free wireless internet there too.
Definitely recommend this hotel!
