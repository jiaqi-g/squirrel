We stayed five nights and had a room facing the street on the 12th floor
It was very quiet and we never experienced street noise
The room was compact
but comfortable
The bathroom was totally remodeled and well decorated
The restaurant in the hotel was closed during the period we stayed at the hotel
so we did not have a chance to try it
We really grew to enjoy the central location
easy walking distance to many of the top sights and several subway stations
There were several good restaurants in the vicinity and a great place for breakfast only half a block away
Service was very good
with all requests promptly and enthusiastically fulfilled
We would often get a coffee in the library in the morning and appreciated the availability of bottled water in the library
Lots of renovation in the immediate area made for lots of scaffolding and congestion
but it didn't really impact our enjoyment of the hotel and location
We would happily recommend The Iroquois and would certainly stay there ourselves on any future trip to NYC
