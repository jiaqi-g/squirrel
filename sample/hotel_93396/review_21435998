This was the 2nd time we have stayed at the Iroquois..in fact, for this visit we didn't even consider staying elsewhere. The location was perfect for all the places we wanted to see.
I had requested a quiet, non smoking room and we were allocated room 808 at the side or back of the hotel (not sure what but it wasn't overlooking the street). It was perfect as the room was quiet, except for the faint hum of the air conditioning units but that didn't bother us. We couldn't hear the usual traffic noise and only hear the occasional siren. If you are a very light sleeper I would recommend ear plugs.
The room was spotlessly clean, with plentiful towels and toiletries. Bathrobes and a hairdryer were provided. Our room had 2 x double beds (classic) and they were so comfortable!. The staff we encountered were polite and helpful. We didn't use the concierge but we did use the bell hop services to store our bags on the last day.
The renovation work was not apparent immediately e.g there was no workmen or noise in the lobby. On closer inspection I could see that there were some finishing touches to be completed but nothing obvious.
The only service we used at the hotel was the useful internet connection in the library area off the lobby. We found other guests to be courteous and would not keep us waiting if we needed to use the computer.
We used the popular Red Flame diner, a 2 minute walk from the hotel, for breakfast. The choice was huge and the breakfasts hot and filling. It opens at 6am, useful if you are awake early from jet lag!
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I am lucky enough to return to New York.
