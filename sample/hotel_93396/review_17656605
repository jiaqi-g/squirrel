WOW is all I can say. We had such a great stay at this hotel. We booked an executive king and were upgraded to a large suite. 
The staff was very friendly. The hotel was small and quiet, what an escape from the big city. Our room was very clean and very large. This trip was so nice, I will ALWAYS book this hotel when I stay in the city. For the price, you can't beat the luxury and friendly service. 
We have stayed in very expensive hotels in the city and this one beats them all.
