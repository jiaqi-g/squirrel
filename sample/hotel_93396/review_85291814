My friend and I stayed here for 5 nights and the room was a little small
well all the surfaces had things on them
tray of drinks as the "minibar"
tray with glasses and ice bucket(ask room service for ice
and brochures/guides for NY and the hotel
But the beds were very comfortable
the room and the bathroom clean and the location just great
had two fabulous meals in the restaurant
pricey
but grat flavours and textures
