My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois back in Thanksgiving 2001. We took advantage of cheaper rooms to support the tourist industry after the dreadful sept. 11th. We wouldn't normally have been able to afford this hotel and as budget travellers Im sure we looked a little out of place showing up with Back-packs instead of Prada suitcases !!!!! 
However we were treated wonderfully......the staff recognizing us after just a few hours, opening door and generally helping us find great places to visit and cool restaurants. The rooms were beautiful and not really too small by New York standards. Gorgeous down comforters, white robes and a bathroom to die for. If I hadn't been so keen to see more of New York I could have stayed in that bed forever !! Being thanksgiving there was a beautiful Xmas tree up in the lobby and constant hot cider available for free.Thanks you Iroquois.If we ever win the lottery we will be back on a regular basis.
