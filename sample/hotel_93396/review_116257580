Excellent location and wonderfully personal and cosy
We required a doctor once we got to new York for an eye infection and Alan the conciege pointed us out in the right direction
The walk in chemist by times square cost us around us$ 300
We definitely be back
just loved the place and the refreshing lemon and lime water every afternoon
what a wonderful idea
Travel tip
buy insurance
because luckily for us
we did and claim the $300 back in full
