My room was very comfortable
The room was clean
It was not large
but had everything I needed
Only one elevator was working so it was nice being on the 2nd floor
although there was no view
The fire alarm in the room kept going off
First in the AM
then again in the PM
Hotel mgt was nice and left chocolate covered strawberries in the room as an apology
One other downside
I charged drinks to the room
they were $20/each
They were basic martini's
fair warning
I had a lemon drop martini
I forget what the other person had
I believe this is overpriced
even for NYC
The location was terrific
close to Times Square
6th Avenue and most of the mid town tourist sites
It was safe and comfortable
the people at the desk were very nice
so overall
