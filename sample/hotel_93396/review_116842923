A magical hotel, with great location
We spent 10 days at this magical hotel, and loved it!
I could go on and on about the service, location, and the hotel it selfâ€¦
But ill just make it easy, and say it was a perfect accommodation.
We had a Executive King room, and it was absolutely lovely. Very clean (but then you get turndown service 2 times a day ;-) ) 
We will for sure live here next time in NYC!
