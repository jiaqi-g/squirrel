This was my third stay at the Iroquois and each time it just keeps getting better. The rooms are small but impeccable. The beds are luxurious and comfortable. The bathroom is completely marble and CLEAN. The staff is accomodating and friendly. And the resturant is excellent. The central location makes getting around Manhattan easy. Within walking distance of great resturants, shopping and just blocks from Times Square. Great for business travel...but I would stay here for pleasure too.
