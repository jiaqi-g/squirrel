This is a jewel of a hotel close to shopping (5th Ave) and the theaters (2 blocks from TImes Square). The rooms are beautiful and the staff is amazing. It will be my new go-to hotel in NYC. If you're considering getting two room, try their King suite. It's gigantic and has a pull-out bed in the living room.
