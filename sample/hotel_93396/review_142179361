I thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at the Iroquois
The staff were courteous
helpful and polite
the location is perfect and the James Dean suite exceeded my expectations
I didn't get a chance to sample the Triomphe but make sure to check out the authentic Greek fare at the nearby Kellari Taverna
Red Flame Diner is great for breakfast
