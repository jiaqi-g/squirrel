The Iroquois is a beautiful hotel with a great location
it is two blocks away from Grand Central and is near Times Square and 5th Avenue
The hotel is small but has the feeling of an Inn tucked away in Manhattan
The rooms are small but elegant
Bathrooms are very clean and bright
Only down side was the noise as our room faced the front of the hotel
We had dinner at the Jewel of India
just down the block
Food was great and not too expensive
the staff was okay
Brunch at Sara Beths on Central Park South
excellent
