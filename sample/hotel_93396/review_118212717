First stay at this storied hotel. Rooms are very nice and well kept daily. Some are on the small side, but not much of an issue when in NYC. Wifi worked well. Elevators never seemed to be much of a wait.
 Easy walk to Times Square , Bryant Park, Grand Central and other spots in this area. No problems or safety concerns even at late night hours following strolls to Times Square.
As others indicated, the staff goes out of their way to be helpful in all respects. Ideas for a restaurant, locations to see, ways to get there - they'll help. One in house matter came up during our visit; the AC in the room was not working. Immediately sent maintenance up to try to resolve. When that didn't work, immediately set us up in another (cooler) room.
If it was good enough for James Dean, it's good enough for me. Book it.
