This is a smaller
older hotel in midtown Manhatten
Our room was very small but the service made up for that
Our room and bathroom were exceptionally clean
We were able to walk to our dinners and Broadway shows without difficulty
There's a diner right next door which serves a great reasonably priced breakfast
I would stay here again
