Stayed at the Iroquois for a long birthday weekend
We were somewhat concerned based on some of the earlier reviews we had read at this site
From our frequent travels into the city and what we had read elsewhere we thought it would be worth a try
We were right
The hotel
is well kept
The staff friendly and helpful
The rooms clean with more than enough room
We had been concerned about some of the earlier
reviews that had said that the rooms were small and tight
We did not find that
The library area and the small
well equipped and functional fitness area were welcome amenities
The closeness of the hotel to the Midtown area was also welcome
The hotel was perfect for a 3
4 day weekend on a luxury scale
Looking forward to returning to usher in the New Year
