My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for our anniversary. It is located very close to Broadway, the theaters, and the subway line. The staff was friendly and helpful. We got several good suggestions for cheap drinks at local watering holes. The rooms are a comfortable size for New York City. The complimentary water was nice. There was supposed to be robes for use during the stay. Unfortunately there was only one robe for two guests and the robe we were given had someone else's hair inside it. The rest of the room appeared clean and well maintained. The sheets were clean and a good quality. The temperature was not really controllable. There is some sort of central air system which limits control of the air conditioning. The room was a bit overly warm during our stay. We were supposed to have a slightly upgraded room from the normal king room. I cannot say I saw anything upgraded about the room we got. In fact we had an undesirable view of an alley and fire escape out of the window. We were able to get a reasonable price for a good hotel at a great location for exploring NYC. The hot coffee in the morning and iced tea in the afternoon in the lobby were a great bonus.
