Stayed for one night
Hotel has a great location and is very clean
The room was nice
about average size for NYC
The bathroom was large and nicely appointed
The towels and bathroom toiletries were top notch
The water pressure was surpisingly good and the bed was very comfortable
Very quiet for NYC on a Saturday night
The front desk and bellmen were very friendly and efficient
The price vs other hotels was a definite vaule
There really were not many negatives
The elevator is shockingly slow
