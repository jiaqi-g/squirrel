stayed for one night. hotel has a great location and is very clean. the room was nice, about average size for nyc. the bathroom was large and nicely appointed. the towels and bathroom toiletries were top notch. the water pressure was surpisingly good and the bed was very comfortable. very quiet for nyc on a saturday night. the front desk and bellmen were very friendly and efficient. the price vs other hotels was a definite vaule. there really were not many negatives. the elevator is shockingly slow.
