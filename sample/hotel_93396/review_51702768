This hotel is small, but very upscale and comfortable. It is located right in the middle of midtown and close to everything....Times Square, Theatre District and walk short walk to Fifth Avenue for all the shopping. 
It is also across the street from the Royalton Hotel which has a great hip bar!
The hotel is immaculate and even though I didn't have a view....it was very cozy and nice!
