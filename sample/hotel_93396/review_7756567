My ten-year-old daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois from 30th May for three nights. We arrived at lunch-time and our room wasn't ready (check-in is at 3) but they stored our bags while we went off for lunch and shopping. Our first room was exquisitely decorated and had a delicious bathroom and an enormous flat-screen tv; but was a little cramped. When I mentioned this to the lady at the front desk she asked if I would like to upgrade to a suite, so we spent our last 2 nights in super luxury (with TWO enormous flat-screen tvs) with our own living room, dining room and kitchen in addition to bed, bath and walk-in closet. The staff were without exception not just friendly and polite but actively kind; I would have to say the service was outstanding - our requests were always attended to quickly and courteously. My daughter loved the free dvd library and the internet access from the itsy-bitsy "library" on the ground floor. The hotel's restaurant, Le Triomphe, was also excellent. The location - midway between Grand Central Station and Times Square - could not have been better. We will definitely stay there again.
