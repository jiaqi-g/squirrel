We had the deluxe room at Iroquois and it did not dissapoint. Whilst not a huge room, there was still plenty of space for the 3 suitcases we ended up with!
The bed was very comfortable, great linens. The room was very quiet, it felt like we were the only guests ever on that floor.
Concierge were helpful with recommendations, and free internet access in library was a bonus.
There were great little 'added extras' which I won't tell you about, as its good to discover them on your own.
