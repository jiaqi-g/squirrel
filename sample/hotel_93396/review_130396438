Stayed for 2 nights early May 2012. 
The hotel is very well located a few blocks from Times square, though very calm. bathroom clean and well equiped. Staff really nice. Nice bar downstairs, though didn't try the food. The gym is quite small
Would definitely recommend it both for business and leisure trips
