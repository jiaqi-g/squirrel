A small hotel compared to many in NYC
but then you don't have to negotiate miles of corridors
The location is excellent for most things in midtown
The staff are friendly and very helpful
Rooms are quite small but then it is a city hotel and we were lucky enough to be given an up
Cleanliness is good except for the carpets which do look grubby
The free WiFi in the room worked
and the complimentary coffee near the reception was appreciated
We would recommend this hotel as a value for money stay in NYC
