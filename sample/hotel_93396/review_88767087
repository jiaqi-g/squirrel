We did an overnight here for Valentine's Day weekend and had dinner at Triomphe downstairs
The block has some great restaurants
so we had a wonderful lunch
then went upstairs to an inordinately dark
awkwardly shaped & furnished
musty room
even for New York City
The marble bathroom was nice and well
appointed and the bed comfortable
but it made me a little crazy to even stay in the room
The lobby is beautiful
but venturing upstairs was an experience in and of itself
nevermind the room once we got there
We tried to work out in the gym the next morning
but it is literally a closet and consisted almost entirely of the sauna and a few Swiss balls and free weights
Dinner at Triomphe was amazing
I highly recommend and will definitely go back
just don't bother going upstairs
