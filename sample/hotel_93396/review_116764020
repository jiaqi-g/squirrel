My sister, neices and I stayed at this hotel for a few days! The hotel was beautiful, clean and had the best location close to broadway, 5th Ave shopping and many good resturants and cafes. The staff were courteous and went out of their way to please us. 
Alan is very knowledgable at the concierge and was so helpful with everything for us; he helped us with providing directions, and guidance and to where to visit with limited time, finding us rental car with reasonable price and best of all making reservation for us at one of the best French resturants ever!
We were so impressed and will be defintely back.
