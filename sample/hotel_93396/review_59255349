If I were going to give this hotel a report card they would get an "A+". The staff went out of their way to make our stay a wonderful experience. They were friendly, courteous, knowledgeable and extremely helpful from the front desk to the chambermaid.
The location was perfect and convenient to everything. The room, while small, was beautifully appointed with all the amenities, including robes, ipod station, turn-down service, pillow chocolates and even a doorbell. The hotel also had a extremely well equipped workout room with sauna and shower.
I would definitely stay here again and in fact plan on doing so. I want to thank the staff for making our stay a very pleasurable and enjoyable experience from start to finish.
Thank you!
