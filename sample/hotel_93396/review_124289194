We stayed in the Iroquois Hotel for my parents' Golden Wedding Anniversary just before Christmas and couldn't have stayed anywhere better
The hotel is home from home with comfortable rooms and a wonderful lobby
bar and restaurant
The staff are unbelievable in every way
They couldn't have done more to make our trip both enjoyable and memorable
Nothing was too much trouble and special mention must go to Vanessa and Alan on Concierge
who could not have been more helpful
They went out of their way (both before we got to NY as well as while we were there) to ensure everything worked smoothly
Patrick on the front desk also went that extra mile to ensure we were comfortable
and the guys on the front door gave us such a wonderful welcome every time we came back that it felt like we were coming home
Thank you to all the staff and I highly recommend you get over there and experience it for yourself
