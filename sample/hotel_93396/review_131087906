Myself and Fiance are just back from a five night stay at The Iroquois and we really loved everything this hotel had to offer
Check in was quick and easy and all the Receptionist staff were very friendly
We were offered an upgrade to our room which we delinced as it was an extra $30 per night (we wanted to keep our money to spend) but it was nice to be offered
After reading a lot of the reviews on here i was worried about the size of the room as people mentioned the rooms were very small
We didnt find this the case
the room was a good size
it fitted us and our suitcases with room to move about
The next time we stay at this hotel i'd like to see what a bigger room has to offer but in our opinion the room was a good size
We stayed in room 805 (superior queen) the only thing i could fault with this room was the view from the window which was just a brick wall
It meant we didnt get much day light coming in and werent to sure what kind of weather it was outside but you dont go to New York to stay in your hotel room so it really didnt matter to us that much
The bathroom was lovely and the molton brown toiletries a really nice touch
The room has a safe which is a must for us and a large closet with iron and ironing board it also has a Dvd player and the hotel offers complementary dvds
We didnt get a chance to speak to the Concierge much as he was always busy with other guests but we did ask what bar would be best to go watch the Scotland vs Usa football match and he directed us to a great bar
All of the staff in the iroquois were so friendly and helpful and coming in to a nightly turn down service after a long day sightseeing was so nice
We will without doubt be staying at The Iroquois again
s the libary has free internet :)
