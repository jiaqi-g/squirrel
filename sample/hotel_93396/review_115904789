I recently stayed at the Iroquois during a business trip to NYC. The location of the hotel is phenomenal. Its located in Midtown, accessible to all the attractions and wonderful shopping that NYC has to offer. Its part of the Small Luxury Hotel group so that is alwasy reassuring! 
The week I was in NYC was one of the hottest times ever. Temps reached over 100 and the heat on the street was unbearable. The first night I checked in, the room was extremely hot and the thermostat was off. I called the front desk and they sent someone up to check it out. All they did was move the thermometer to 50 degrees. This did absolutely nothing. I tossed and turned all night and was only able to sleep for 2 hours due to the intense heat. After several complaints, I was told that someone would be up in my room by 8:30am the next morning to correct the problem. Noone appeared until I had to once again call and complain about the situation. This was after my 5th phone call! I was never offered to switch to another room and no additional amenity was sent for my inconvenience. Although they claim to have "fixed" the issue it was still very warm in the room and somewhat uncomfortable throughout my entire stay. 
On a positive note, the bellmen were extremely helpful and the concierge was very knowledgable. Its a great cozy property and once again great location if only they can get their AC on the ball... :)
