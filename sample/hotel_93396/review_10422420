I'll start by saying I will rate this place 3
5 out of 5
The Iroquois is in a great location in downtown NYC
very close to the theater district and hundreds of shops and restaurants
Upon arriving
we were asked if we needed help with our bags
which we declined
It wasn't clear whether our room was ready when we asked (even though it was an hour after check
in time) but nonetheless
within a few minutes
we were on our way up the elevator
The room that my girlfriend and I shared was costly compared to its size (almost $600 for a suite that barely fits a king sized bed
a small desk
and a dresser)
However
the hotel itself as well as the room was very clean and classy
The bed linens were also particularly nice
and comfortable
The plasma HDTV was nice
especially for watching game 3 of the Red Sox vs Rockies world series
However
none of the HD channels worked
and neither did the HBO
For the price we paid
I was going to take advantage of the free overnight shoe
shining they offered
You put your shoes in a bag outside your door by 12 AM
and by 6 AM your shoes are back and shiny
Apparently there was a malfunction since my shoes were never shined
We asked about the HD channels and the shoe shining when we checked out
but we were answered with what basically amounted to an "oops
" The HD had stopped working
and the hotel was unable to get technicians in on the weekend to fix it
In other words
they were too cheap to pay the weekend rate
since in NYC I find it hard to believe that someone wasn't available to perform this service
Most of our time was spent outside of the hotel anyway
and TV is not generally one of my concerns
We were happy to have our parking ticked validated for the garage across the street
the hotel's claimed discount was wrong
and we ended up paying more than we thought for parking
So overall this place is nice and comfortable
but nothing special
at least in our experience
