I recently stayed at this hotel with a friend of mine for four nights when we visited NYC
We weren't sure what to expect as we went off of reviews from here and viewed picturs uploaded by others on this website
When we arrived the staff was very welcoming and took our bags up to our room
The room and bathroom was very small; however
this was to be expected for NYC
The location was amazing
it was a 4 min walk to Times Square
The staff was very friendly and answered any questions we had including the fastest way to get to a particular place
They also provided us extra pillows and towels when we requested them and band
aids for my friend who got blisters from walking all day
The check
in and check
out was a very smooth process and did not take long at all
When we return to NYC
we will be staying here again
