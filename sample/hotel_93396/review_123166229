We have stayed in Midtown several times but ths was our first experience at the Iroquois. The location is great, within walking distance to theaters, restaurants, etc. The employees were very courteous and friendly. Didn't eat at the restaurant but had drinks in the bar, which is nice. The rooms are very nicely furnished although they are quite small compared to similarly priced alternatives in the area. The only problem we had was the noise from the street. We were originally in a 5th floor room facing the street. We asked to be moved but were told they didn't have other rooms, but they said the room was "sound proof." No so. We heard every car, voices from the street, garbage trucks in the middle of the night, horns, etc.
