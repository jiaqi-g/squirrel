We stayed for 4 nights in June 2011
This was our first time to NYC and we did a lot of research into the many different hotels that were on offer
To say we were a little nervous about what the hotels were going to be like we eventually decided on the Iroquis
The Iroquis is in a perfect location
it is close enough to Times Square and the Theatre district to walk
but far enough away from the hustle and bustle to feel like you're getting away from it
I always enjoyed coming back to the hotel as it seemed like a calm oasis in amongst the madness of Times Square
The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout the trip and were always on hand if we needed any assistance
As for the rooms there were very nice
not the largest in the world but this is New York right? The bed was extremely comfortable and after a hard days walking it was heaven
Room and bathroom were clean and the bathroom was well stocked with Molten and Brown products
Only downside I could think of was that the elevators were a little on the slow side but we didn't really mind as we were on vacation and weren't in a rush
Apart from that I'd definately recommend the Iroquis
