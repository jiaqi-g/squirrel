This is an excellent small hotel (by New York standards) in a quiet location of Midtown within a few minutes walk of Times Square
the Theatre District
Bryant Park and Grand Central
The room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable and the staff were friendly and efficient
There was always free coffee available in the lobby and the library had internet access and real time flight info
I can't comment on the restaurant as we didn't eat in
I would however recommend the Red Flame diner just along the street
where you can eat breakfast with real New Yorkers at a reasonable cost
There's also Gregory's coffee bar opposite the diner which serves an awesome carrot and raisin pound cake
This was our first visit to New York and we'll definitely be back for more
