Just returned from a business trip to NYC and stayed at the Iroquois. Could not have been better. Was upgraded to a 1-bedroom suite (a pleasant surprise) and the rooms were spacious, clean, lovely and quiet - a premium in NYC. The location is superb, near everything and we walked to everything. Would highly recommend the hotel. The staff could not have been more helpful.
