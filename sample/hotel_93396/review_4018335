My husband and I stayed here for our 6th wedding anniversay
we booked a Deluxe King
which was very small and extremely hot
No screens in the window
so you can't open them without getting more than fresh air in
we repeatedly asked the front desk staff to ensure our room was made cooler
and the response every time was that it "would be taken care of immediately"
it never was
though after spending 3 nites sweating and complaining
the morning of our checkout they asked if they could send an electrician up
big help
We ate breakfast
once at the Hotel restaurant
we asked for additional piece of toast which we were charged $9
00 for and if we had gotten green tea instead of regular tea with our breakfast they would have charged us $6
00 for the tea bag
On either side of the Hotel is the Alogonquin and the Sofitel Hotel
both of which always had a bellman stationed outside to assist with cabs
more often than not the Iroqois you you getting your own cab
no bellman outside
Extremely short staffed hotel
They gave us wrong directions
bad advise
the conceirge
instead of helping us find restaurants handed us a Zagat survey to fend for ourselves
This Hotel surprisingly is a member of the SLH (Small Luxury Hotels)
it should be a member of the SNLH (Small NON Luxury Hotels)
