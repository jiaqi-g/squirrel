Spent three nights at The Iroquois. The stay was great. Our room had NO view, but it was oh so quiet. 
Two elevators made getting out easier. The in-room safe was easy to use and made me feel more secure leaving my valuables. 
The location was so convenient. Right off Fifth Avenue, near Times Square, walking distance to Central Park. We used the Times Square subway to get around. 
The concierge helped our party navigate the city and scored hard-to-get tickets.
