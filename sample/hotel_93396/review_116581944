Amazing bed
convenient commuter location
excellent service
Great rate on a last minute booking
checked in and received an upgrade through a consortium program (thanks Iroquois
12th floor
room to breathe without burning plastic in NYCâ€”rare
Doorbells too
nifty
Not the most luxurious entrance
and neither of us were able to connect to WiFi in the room but we were off duty
it wasn't critical
and the staff's hospitality made up for it
More friendly and welcoming than boutiques at quadruple the price
I've hotel hopped throughout the city
will keep this one in my pocket
Plus ice cold citrus infused water at the entrance: essential for summer in the concrete jungle
