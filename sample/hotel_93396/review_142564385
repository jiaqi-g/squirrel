My friend and I recently visited NYC from Texas for the first time and were SO glad to have found the Iroquois. It was a haven in the middle of the city. The staff was top notch and very helpful. The concierge was super helpful and Patrick, at the front desk was super nice and accomodating. It's a quick walk to many, many locales and we always felt safe in our surroundings. We will DEFINITELY stay at The Iroquois when returning to NY.
