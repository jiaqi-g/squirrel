A wonderfully well
and quite economical
but not "cheap" when it comes to overall feel and the establishment's appointments
hotel in the middle of All Things Mid
Town (at 49 W
44th St
The Iroquois is staffed by people who are knowledgeable
friendly
courteous
helpful and tuned in to their customers' needs
big and small
The rooms are modern
super
crisply appointed and economically spacious
The lobby is alive bustling
along the lines of a fine European hotel; the desk and concierge staff knows its stuff; the two bars are a lot of fun; the first
floor library is a great place to relax
get some work done
or people watch; and the food
no matter the meal
in Triomphe is first rank
My two teenaged daughters
who are seasoned travelers
love The Iroquois and its people
and want to stay there again on our next trip to NY
high praise
indeed
from one tough
please audience
