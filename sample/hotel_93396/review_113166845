This is one of the most welcoming, friendly places in NYC. The staff is very professional, helpful and just made the entire trip easy. The room was comfortable; excellent bed linens. The room was quiet and felt away from all the hub-bub of the city while still being within a few blocks of the theater district, 5th Avenue and Grand Central. Highly recommended.
