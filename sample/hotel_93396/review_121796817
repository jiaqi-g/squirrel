We travel a lot and Iroquois is our home away from home
From the minute you arrive
to your check out
the service is wonderful
Everyone remembers your name
is polite and courteous and attends to your every need
Bill and Thomas at the door are the "dynamic duo
" The rooms are comfortable
clean and well appointed
The beds are heaven
This is a must see
must stay boutique hotel
