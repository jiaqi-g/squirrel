year old daughter took a mommy
daughter trip to N
recently and lucked out when we checked into The Iroquois
From the comfort of our quiet room
with its hugely inviting beds
to the prompt attention from the staff
we were impressed all the way
My daughter needed the attention of a doctor
Within minutes
we were referred to a physician and 30 minutes later
the front desk called back to make sure that the doctor had called
Our location was ideal
The Red Flame next door was perfect for room take
outs and kid
friendly breakfasts (great choc chip pancakes
per my daughter
Times Square and The Lion King were within walking distance and we never had difficulty getting a cab
Would love to go back
