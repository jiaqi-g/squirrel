A quaint little hotel in the mist of all the hustle of New York. The staff was very pleasant and welcoming. Our room was very clean and the bed very comfortable, the only flaw (and it's minor) is that our room was very tiny. We stayed in an Executive King, small but very clean. Hotel is in a good location and would feel very comfortable recommending this hotel. We enjoyed our stay.
