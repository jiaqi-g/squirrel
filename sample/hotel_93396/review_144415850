I have just come to the end of a 9 night stay
It was supposed to be 3 but we had to stay on due to Hurricane Sandy
The staff have been exceptionally helpful and accommodating given our circumstances
I have have heard all sorts of horror stories from other 'stranded' travellers this week and it appears we certainly struck lucky
The location of the hotel is perfect too
Just a short walk to Time Square and yet far enough to escape the noise
5th Avenue is literally around the corner and Grand Central is just 5 minutes walk
I don't like recommending hotels as everyone has different expectations
but the Iroquois has exceeded mine this last week or so
for so many reasons
Thank you Team Iroquois
