I booked the Iroquois as a surprise for my partners 50th birthday
our first trip to New York
With the location
service
help from the Iroquois staff family
the fantastic Triomphe restaurant
and the very comfy Lantern's Keep bar/salon the trip was perfect
it was very hard to take ourselves away from such a great Hotel
Unfortunately time didn't allow a workout in the gym
did manage to visit it briefly on leaving as a way of freshening up before heading for the airport
just another little helpful service that typifies the style of this Hotel
The gym itself was well equipped and would clearly allow you to have a good workout after a days sightseeing
In planning my partner’s surprises I found an incredible ally in Vanessa the Chief Concierge
Nothing seemed to be too much trouble and everything was arranged to suit our plans – right down to somehow arranging a special lightning show during the Birthday dinner – I really believe she can work miracles to help out
Thanks Vanessa
Fear not if she’s not around when you need help – the rest of the team will step in to assist
The Hotels location is superb – with a short walk you can be in Grand Central
or Times Square
Broadway
Empire State Building
so many fantastic attractions in the area
A slightly longer walk will see you in Central Park – plenty to enjoy there too
With subway’s close by there really is nowhere you can’t easily get to
Needless to say the room had everything Wendy and I needed and the Housekeeping team ensured it was kept clean and fresh for us every day
After such an enjoyable introduction to New York there can only be one thing to do on future follow up visits – book the Iroquois and have a great visit
Can’t wait to return
