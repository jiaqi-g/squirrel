This was our 5th stay in the last 2 years
One would think you would know exactly what to expect when you arrive
we were completely amazed when we checked in
We arrived at 2PM
which was 1 hour prior to check in time
They were so apologetic that our room was not available that they gave us free drinks at the bar while we waited
We didn't expect our room to be ready
yet they really went above and beyond to make sure we weren't upset
When our room was finally ready
they informed us that we had been upgraded to their presidential suite
When we arrived
we found a HUGE room
by not only NYC standards
but by all standards
There was a livingroom
dining room
full kitchen
beautiful bedroom with a king sized bed and wonderful marbled bathroom with separate shower and jetted bathtub
It was simply amazing
As with all of our past stays
the hotel is impeccably clean
wonderul Molten Brown ammenities
Frette linens/robes
wonderful bed linens and very classic decor
We had visited some of our friends that were also in the city for a wedding with us and looked at their hotel rooms and it seems the trend is to look very "trendy" "ikea
ish" and this is definitely not the look the Iroquois is going for
This is a classic
upscale hote and I will say I am VERY picky with hotels
My husband will tell anyone that I am a hotel snob and I will ONLY EVER stay at the Iroquois while in Manhattan
The location is centrally located in Midtown Manhattan
3 blocks from Rockefeller
Times Square and a short walk to The Empire State Building and Central Park
The staff warmly welcome you everytime you enter the hotel and their attention to detail is apparent
I would recommend this hotel to anyone that asks and will definitely return
