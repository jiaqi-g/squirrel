This hotel was wonderful, Billy the doorman was a true delight everyday. Everyone at this hotel was great. Our room was lovely. I would suggest this hotel to anyone that plans to stay in New York near Time Square. This is my 4th trip to NYC and out of all the other hotels I have stayed this was the best. Again it was wonderful.
