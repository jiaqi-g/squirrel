First time to New York
would definitely recommend the Iroquois
outstanding location near Times Square but far enough from the noise
room was quite small
which is typical for NYC from what we've heard
comfy beds
wonderful shower
pleasant staff
all made for an outstanding trip and anniversary celebration
Would highly recommend O'Lunney's Pub
Cranberries
Cafe Europa
and Kellaria Taverna
Would not recommend the double decker bus tour
All in all
an amazing trip
Can't wait to return
