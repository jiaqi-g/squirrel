"A Little Bit of Heaven in New York City"
We spent a weekend in hectic New York City around the Christmas holidays and had a wonderful experience I would like to share with everyone. We started out expecting to run into some problems, my husband and I and my daughter and her husband - from the time I booked the Iroquois everything went very smooth and very professional. When we got there I asked if perhaps we could get an upgrade and GUESS WHAT! they had a suite open and offered it to us at a minimal cost and we took it -WHAT A JOY!
Beautiful, clean and everthing we needed at our fingertips - the staff was very professional, offering us our privacy but taking care of all our needs. I loved it. The lounge and the restaurant are superb. I can't tell you the feeling of being in a hectic, busy city and feeling like you are at a bed and breakfast in the country. Quiet and cozy. The beds are especially comfy. I highly recommend the suite for comfort and room. I can't wait to go to the Iroquois again.
