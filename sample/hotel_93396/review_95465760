Don't get me wrong
the Iroquios is a great hotel in an excellent location on 44th st
It's just that the little things weren't quite nailed and it's often those little things that make the difference between a good hotel and an excellent one
My business colleagues stayed at the Morgans group's Royalton across the street at the same price which although much hipper and up to date than the Iroquios was more of a scene (and a potentially noisier one at that)
On the con side:
I arrived an hour earlier than check
in time so they may have rushed my room cleaning
particularly the vacuuming
When I checked into my room after 3pm
I nearly stepped on a safety pin embedded in the carpet and at a closer look found other small plastic objects in the carpet
so clearly vacuuming wasn't adequate
I booked a wake up call which didn't happen
The bathrooms are a little tired
There was a wall safe in the room (which is a pro
) attached to an exterior wall
The door was wide open and I couldn't figure out how to close it
As it was at shin height blocking the walkway to the bathroom I had to wedge a lamp up against it to prevent injury
Pro's:
The beds are heavenly
Soooo comfortable and topped with plush feather duvets
Staff are friendly
the Gilly espresso at the Triomphe restaurant (which is part of the hotel ) is so good it's up to European standards
My room was very quiet
not a sound heard
wireless internet is free
