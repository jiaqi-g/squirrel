We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois
It has a wonderful location and is within walking distance of Times Square
5th Avenue
Broadway and
a bit of a distance
but still walkable
Central Park
We were in town for a family member's birthday
and they even gave her a little birthday basket
I would definitely stay there again
Staff was very friendly and very helpful
They even have a turn down service at night
