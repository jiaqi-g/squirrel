We just spent three very pleasant nights at the Iroquois in NYC
The hotel's location is its best feature
located on West 44th
a few blocks from Central Park
and a short walking distance from the Theatre district
The room price was very reasonable for a New
York luxury hotel
and we were automatically upgraded to a DeLuxe room upon our check
The room was on the small side
very clean and well
appointed
and the bathroom was spotless
We found very friendly and helpful
and we appreciated the many small touches that made us feel welcome (complimentary water in the room
chocolates on the pillow
complimentary NY Times in the morning and free wireless Internet)
The only two items that were less than perfect was wireless coverage (the desk in room 1207 appeared to be unable to get coverage)
and the noise of the AC system
which required my wife to sleep with ear plugs
All in all
we felt the hotel was a very good choice in NYC primarily due to its location
and to its attentive service
We will likely come back
