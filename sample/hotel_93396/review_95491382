From start to finish, The Iroquois could not have been better. It started with a lovely reservationist (capable and pleasant), fabulous front desk, wonderful concierge (Alan!!), perfect room service (Benny!!!) as well as kind,considerate and capable bellman.
Our room was not huge but it was clean and well-appointed.SOOOOOOO CLEAN!!! I love that!!! We managed to get reservations for dinner at Po even though it was restaurant week in NYC...the whole trip was perfect with thanks to the professional staff at The Iroquois and the excellent food at Po.
