I recently spent 3 days at the Iroquois hotel and could not have been happier with the experience.
While the room was small, it was more than adequate for my needs.
The front desk staff was quick to respond to any calls from my traveling companion or myself.
Vanessa, the concierge, was fabulous. She was able to get us tickets for a completely sold out show (even stub hub, and ticket brokers could not get us tickets).
She also made us numerous dinner reservations, and found us tickets for another sold out show.
She always responded to our requests with a smile and a positive attitude
She was a pleasure to deal with. 
She, alone, would be enough of a reason to stay at the Iroquois, again.
