My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois during a recent weekend trip to New York and really enjoyed our stay
Our room was small
but clean and very nicely furnished
The service was friendly
and the large flat
screen TV and DVD player in the room were a nice touch
The hotel's location near times square
is extremely hectic
and probably should be avoided if you don't like crowds
But this location is very convenient if you are in NYC to see theater
The reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5 star is that for the price
I was hoping for something a little bit extra
like more spacious rooms or inclusive breakfast
Tips:
The restaurant in the hotel (Le Triompe) is fantastic
I tried their 6
course tasting menu for dinner and fond memories of it still linger in my mind
db Bistro moderne (a restaurant a few steps from the hotel) is also great
The International Center of Photography is very close to the hotel and is worth a visit
