I stay at this hotel often
perhaps five or six times a year
I had tried maybe six or seven other hotels in mid
town before I found this one
I travel a lot with work and this hotel has a very pleasant
friendly atmosphere and the rooms are very comfortable
The wireless internet has improved to the point where it is now seamless and the restaurant is exceptional
The manager Zoraida and the staff are what makes this place special
