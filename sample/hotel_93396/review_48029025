Came to the city for one night to celebrate my "not 50th" birthday
Upon checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite for the occasion
The suite was lovely and included a living room
large bedroom
dining room
kitchen
walk in closet and bathroom
As mentioned before
the bathroom was tiny but included a stall shower and a jetted tub
The suite was so nice that we decided to skip our shopping trip (it was also pouring down rain) and stay in the room to read and watch college football
We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant
Triomphe
which was fabulous
The service there was great and we walked to the theater in plenty of time
Two small complaints
the wood (?) floors in the suite were very slick even in rubber soled shoes and a morning newspaper would have been a nice touch
We will return to The Iroquois
