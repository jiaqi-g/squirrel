Stayed two nights here
Excellent location for exploring midtown
Times Sq
Bryant Park
5th Ave
all close by
Hotel room a good size for a NY hotel
but we had one of the large rooms on the top floor
Very helpful staff at this location
from the bellboys to the concierge who had good restaurant recommendations (try out the db moderne next door for breakfast) and we were able to not only store our bags on check out day
but we used the gym shower facilities before traveling on
would definitely stay here again for a Manhattan visit
