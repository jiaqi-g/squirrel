We stayed here for 4 nights from 28th
1st July
The hotel is small but friendly
clean and well appointed
The rooms are nice but small
beds very comfortable The bathroom's are tiny
there is very little natural light and the back rooms we were in had no view
Only one small lift working for 12 floors
Having said that
it is ideally situated for all the main sights being on 44th and 6th
So just around the corner from Times Square and 5th Avenue
and a short walk to Grand Central Station and therefore easy to get to all the wonderful sights of NYC
Parking cost $35 a night in a car park opposite
Staff always helpful
