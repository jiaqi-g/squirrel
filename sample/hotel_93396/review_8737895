As a transplanted native New Yorker who travels to the City on business at least twice a month, I try to stay at The Iroquois as often as I possibly can. I can count on smiling faces and consistently considerate service and amentities when I come "home" after horrible flight or back-to-back meetings. And, they have a fabulous flight status tool that has saved me many hours hanging around airports. JQuinn,Chapel Hill, NC
