Location was great - convenient to everywhere, beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were very quiet and clean, staff was very pleasant, and nice diner two doors down to get a quick bite to eat. Only thing that I would have changed would be to have ice machines on each floor, rather than having to call room service for ice. But I will definitely stay hear again.
