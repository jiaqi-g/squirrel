Nice and in the perfect location.
I took my mother away to visit NYC for Mothers Day.
Booked a twin room which was a little bit pokey, but apart from that sufficient. 
Your right in the centre of everything which is just fantastic and the subway is close too.
I don't really have anything bad to say except the room wasn't particularly capacious.
The staff were fine and the concierges great. Also free Wifi which is very very handy.
Having stayed in other 4 star Hotels i'm not sure whether its really 4 star or more of a 3 star, but that may be just down to my perception about what i would expect for a 4 Star hotel.
Its fine, lovely, good staff, perfect location and very nice. 
I wasn't wowed as i would expect from a 4 Star hotel but it was fine apart from that it was fine.
