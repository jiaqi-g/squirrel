The Iroquois is elegant, beautifully-appointed and friendly. The rooms, while "small" anywhere outside Manhattan, were quite comfortable and of the size typical of mid-town hotels, and the beds were heavenly. You won't find a quieter hotel room in mid-town. No sound room-to-room, and no outside sounds. The desk clerks and concierge were like having your own personal staff -- never too busy; always cheerful and helpful. The location -- 44th at 6th Ave., next to the Algonquin, is a 5-minute walk to Times Sq. and the theaters, as well as Rockefeller Center and Grand Central Terminal. The Empire State Bldg is just 10 blocks -- about 15 minutes' walk -- from the hotel, and there are a number of good, less-expensive restaurants within 5-minutes from 44th to 46th between 6th and 7th. Hailing a taxi on 44th or 6th Ave. was a breeze. We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience with our 10-yr.-old grandaughter at The Iroquois.
