The Iroquois is conveniently located to my Times Square office and is on my company's list of preferred hotels in NYC
Hence
I stayed there a lot
Six times over 3 months
in fact
THE GOOD: Easy access to east side and west side train lines
Penn Station
and Grand Central
Very helpful and pleasant staff
Nice hotel bar but more interesting across the street
Comfy beds
THE "MEH": Spotty WiFi depending on the location of your room
Most rooms have windows that open to the airshaft
Very small rooms
a great place to stay in Manhattan
NYC can be very hit
miss and you really can't go wrong here
They just need to work on that WiFi situation
I lived and worked in NYC for 10 years and left just over a year ago
I know what I'm talking about
