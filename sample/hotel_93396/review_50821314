Stayed at the hotel before. Love its centrally located Times Square location. (Gossip Girl was taping at the hotel and we got to experience some of that action!) Now more about the hotel. Upscale, European/boutique, meticulous and top notch service from the concierge (Nick) and the doorman (Bill). When Bill realized it was my mom's birthday, he sent a bottle of wine to the room. How sweet. The hotel's restaurant, Triomphe, was just that. Enjoyed a fabulous martini, glass of wine and the scallops appetizer (while waiting for my mom to arrive from the airport). Our room was 2 queens. Love the leather headboards and all of the furnishings. Marble and brass bath. All of this...for an extremely reasonable $300+/night. Personable service. I will definitely stay here again!! Thanks Iroquois!
