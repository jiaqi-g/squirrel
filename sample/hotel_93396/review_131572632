I chose the Iroquois hotel after reading several reviews and I am happy to state that I was not disappointed. My daughter & I chose this hotel as it was in the Times Square district and close to the theatres.
Arrival: We arrived mid-morning and our room was already prepared.
Housekeeping: This was superb. The housekeeping staff provided excellent service both morning and night staff. The rooms were always spotlessly clean. We also requested a small fridge upon arrival and it was brought to our room within 10 minutes.
Triomphe Restaurant: Loved the ambiance. We only had breakfast ... what can I say the best "Eggs Benedict" I have had so far. Did not have the opportunity to have dinner as we were only there for a weekend. I will definitely make it a point to try dinner the next time we visit.
Rooms: As expected hotel rooms are a bit smaller in NY. However, the use of space was very effective, e.g. mirrors placed strategically. We had a room with double beds & overall the room was very comfortable.
I would definitely return to this hotel.
