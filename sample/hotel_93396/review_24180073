Stayed at the Iroquois for 4 nights on a sightseeing / shopping trip to New York. First impressions were great - very efficient check in, nice staff, well finished room, lovely comfy beds, bath robes and Molton Brown toiletries. We spent our first night on the 11th floor but had problems with a broken thermostat (which left the room severely over heated) and noise from some sort of fan or vent outside our window (imagine an extractor fan full on over your head all day and night!). We were moved to the 4th floor the following morning with minimal fuss, which solved the temperature problem but unfortunately, not the noise. Everthing else about the hotel was perfect, including the location (on a relatively quiet street but just a short walk from Times Square) and the staff were really nice, but unfortunately everthing was overshadowed by the noise. Could only recommend if you could be guaranteed a room in a different part of the hotel.
