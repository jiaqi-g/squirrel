Perhaps I've been spoilt on my previous trips to the US
but I picked this as a boutique hotel thinking it might have more charm etc than one of the big ones
The location was great
but I have to say for the money the room was so tiny
litterally room for the bed and the bathroom was dated
Staff were very pleasant
but wouldn't say they went the extra mile
