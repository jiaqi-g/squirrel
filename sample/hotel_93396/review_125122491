I last reviewed the Iroquois in 2006. Six years later I can say that the hotel continues its high standards. The hotel is intimate and has the ambiance of a private club. The hotel is over 100 years old, yet it has many modern touches such as free wi-fi, updated bathrooms and luxurious linens. Be sure to dine at the Triomphe restaurant as it is one of the best restaurants in NYC. Service is impecable and the location could not be better. The Iroquois is always my first choice in Manhattan. It should be your's too.
