This hotel was simply elegant
contemporary and a true find
The hotel is only 3 to 4 stories
but it surpasses the skyrise hotels by far
It's only 3 blocks from Times Square and offered daily complimentary hot cider
Staff was nice and helpful
We got the deluxe room with king size bed
(Deluxe rooms feature queen or king
so make your preference known
) But the standout feature was FREE WIRELESS INTERNET IN YOUR ROOM
you can't beat this hotel
it's wins "best all around
" (The only "con" was the $20 per person continental breakfast at the hotel's restaurant
But walk down 3 doors and have a hearty meal at the local diner for half the cost
) Would definitely return
