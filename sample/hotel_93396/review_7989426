I was traveling with a girlfriend to NY to see a show (Blackbird with Jeff Daniels
if you get a chance
see it
) We chose the Iroquois based on TripAdvisor reviews
A few days before we were to arrive I got a call confirming that I had requested a room with two queens and they wondered if I could accepta a room with a single King Size bed
My friend and I did not want to share a bed
The woman on the phone assured me it would not be a problem
When we arrived
however
the front desk informed us that they had no rooms with two beds
could we take a room with a single King Size bed? I was about to get hot under the collar and reminded her that I had just confirmed a room with two queens a couple of days before
She quickly offered us TWO rooms for the price of one
we each got our own room with a queen size bed and our own bathroom
Now THAT is what I call customer service
We had a lovely stay
the rooms had recently been renovated and were luxurious
I plan to stay at the Iroquois every chance I get
