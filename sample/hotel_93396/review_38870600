Beautiful small boutique hotel right smack in the heart of NYC tourist attractions
I'll get to the point:
Rooms
we stayed in a Classic with 2 double beds
Beds were comfy with lots of feather pillows
I prefer foam
but it was late & didn't bother to ask if they had that
Bed & bath linens were soft
comfy & plush
2 spa slippers & 1 bath robe provided (nope
it stays with the hotel)
Room & bathroom were very clean & with upgraded furniture
fixtures & tile
There was a good size safe in the closet
Flat screen TV
robobar (touch 1 item & it automatically charges
whether or not you took it out
so don't attempt to use this as a fridge)
Pack & play was *free* for my toddler
We were told small fridge was also free
but it was not available for the 2 nights we were there
Turndown service with chocolates left on your pillow (they were good too)
Our room was towards the back corner of the bldg
window had the fire escape stairs & faced the side windows of the bldg next door
At first
we were disappointed with no view
but upon coming back at 1 pm
found out we were fortunate as the garbage trucks came loudly in the wee hours of the morning
& the honking of the morning buslte was not something we'd like to wake up to so very early in the morning during vacation
Kids
we have 2 boys
8 & 2 y
; hotel has a kids amenities package that is again *free*
Just request it
Kids got a small cookie & fruit plate
a bathrobe & slippers (though it was adult size)
a full size bottle of bubble bath (they got Disney Cars)
& a pamphlet for NYC attractions for kids
Internet
worked well for us
but then again we used it after midnight so may not be a lot of folks online
Parking
across the street from the hotel (Hippodrome)
We were told it was $34
00 for 24 hours (don't know if tax incl) as long as you have it stamped by the hotel
but no in
out priviledge (we didn't use this)
Parking garage had an overnight special of $10
00 if you come in after a certain time & it's good for 12 hours
My hubby still wanted his parking tkt stamped & we paid $9
00 (this is a steal in NYC
still a $1 discount which went to the parking valet guy
By the way
we have a Honda minivan & parking garages typically charge extra for taller/longer vehicles
so the parking price was definitely a steal
At lunch time
we discovered that the parking meters & places I used to park at years ago are long gone
so we paid $20
00 for 1 hour at a parking garage near Madison & Grand Central
but still cheaper than getting your car towed
Lost & found
not so good part
We thought we left someone important for our toddler & called 4 times Monday
the housekeeper took my info & asked me to call back in 15 minutes
Got stuck at work & couldn't call for another hour
another housekeeper told me to call back again
called again left a voicemail with details & call back info
Tuesday
houseman took my item & contact info & said he will have supv call as lost & found items are locked in the office
didn't hear from anyone
Wednesday
called & asked to speak to the hskp supv to whom I explained my several attempts of getting in touch with Lost & Found
& who again took my info
said she'll check & call me back
After 3 hours
I called again & spoke to the same hskp supv who said they didn't find anything
I asked why she didn't call me back & she said she was busy
no apologies
I replied that I wished she had called me back
that would just be good customer service after all my attempts to call for the past 3 days
I believe that customer service should be extended to the guest even after they've checked out
For this
I took 1 star off
Other than that
we liked this hotel & would stay again
Only next time
I would triple/quadruple check my stuff before leaving
