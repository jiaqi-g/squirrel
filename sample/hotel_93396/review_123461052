My mom and I were in NYC for a wedding and had an amazing experience in this beautiful and comfortable hotel with a friendly customer service! The rooms were clean, as a matter of fact we had our rooms cleaned twice a day which was amazing! We had a choice of watching free movies in room from their complimentary movie rental service! Amazing staff, helped us around to get to airport and wedding on time! We were walking distance from time square which was very convenient! I highly recommend this hotel, and will only stay here the next time we visit NYC!!
