Our 3 day stay at the Iroquois Hotel was perfect
Concierge Alan went out of his way to remedy a transportation problem we encountered
Alan and Vanessa were always so pleasant and helpful in giving directions and information
We found the hotel to be very clean and tastefully furnished
Complimentary coffee in the lobby was a BIG PLUS
There was never any noise from the street or the hallway
The front desk staff and the doormen were also very friendly and helpful
Great location
We highly recommend the Iroquois and will surely stay there again when we return to NYC
