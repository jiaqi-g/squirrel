I spent three nights with my daughter - who had never been to New York before - and specifically wanted a boutique hotel that would seem more personal. We felt that the hotel was home and were happy to return at the end of each of three busy days of walking , shopping and theater. The room, though small, had comfortable beds with lovely Frette linens. The marble bathroom was furnished with plenty of towels and lots of Molton Brown toiletries. The staff was gracious and attentive and the Triomphe Restaurant was outstanding. The Iroquois is a member of Small Luxury Hotels and they always have superior properties on their list.
