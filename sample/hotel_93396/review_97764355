I won't stay anywhere else when in NYC. The staff is friendly and attentive. The concierges are knowledgeable and helpful and will even help you navigate the subway system. We called when we were out and about and they found us a great spot for dinner. Close to theater, Empire State Bldg and Time Square- yet on a quiet street (for NYC) Rooms are well appointed. Though we traveled with children and they provide a special kids "package" with playing cards, slippers and a robe, this is an adult hotel and fit for couples. Nice complimentary work out facility too. Will be back as soon as time allows.
