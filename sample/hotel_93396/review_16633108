Wonderful
The staff was friendly
Our room service was prompt
Loved the bathroom
Very clean
elegant
and we loved the option of opening the windows
It let so much light it
We had a flat screen tv in our room (the hubby loved that part)
We booked this hotel for our second honeymoon and it just fit it perfectly
Our only annoyance? The slooooooooow elevators
I was impressed that our room was in between both elevators
and yet we never heard any foot traffic
It was so quite and just wonderful
We'd definitely stay there again
Wonderful location
