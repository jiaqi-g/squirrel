I have stayed at many hotels in NYC and the Iroquois was one of the best experiences I've had thus far
The hotel was very clean and well appointed from lobby to room
Italian marble in the bathrooms and bathroom fixtures were impeccable
The room was very clean and well arranged and linens were high
quality and very comfortable
The big plus was the staff
All were welcoming with a smile and ready to serve and all very knowledgable about the neighborhood and NYC attractions
The restaurant and bar
TRIOMPHE was excellent and the hotel is centrally located and close to Times Square and browadway attractions
I will definitely return and have already recommended the hotel to a handful of others
