I stayed three nights at The Iroquois last week
on a business trip
Although on my own
I had one of the biggest NY hotel rooms I've stayed in
I could actually walk around it without bumping into furniture
Flat screen TV
complimentary half bottle of wine
water
truffles (sign up for their executive program
it's free)
and NY Times in the morning
free Wi
Huge bathroom
totally modern
with lovely tiles
Molton Brown goodies
and lots of fluffy white towels
The room was the super quiet
I never heard anyone next door
above or below
And the bed and pillows were just right
Nice desk area for working
a decent sized closet
my view was of the fire escape
but that's pretty much all you get in NY
so I'm fine with that
If I want a view
I can go out into the street
I ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine
although I'd like a stronger cup of coffee and less salt in my eggs
The first night I had a drink in the restaurant bar and had the best Cosmo I've had in years
The staff are all super helpful and polite
with one possible exception
a group of us was in the front 'Library' room having a meeting and were told very abruptly and with no warning that we all had to move immediately as they had to set up for a dinner
It was 4pm
so we were herded into the restaurant bar
where all the employees seemed to make as much noise as they could
I'd assumed the 'Libary' was a public room as it had computers in it
and it was empty when we walked in
Aside from that one issue
it was a great stay
And I'd definitely put it high on my list for a return trip
Super convenient location
far enough from Time Square not to be bothered by the noise
but close enough to all the things I needed to get to
