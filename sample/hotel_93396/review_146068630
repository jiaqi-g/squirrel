I recently stayed in this hotel for three nights during a visit to NY. What a gem of a place. From the perfect location, only minutes from Time Square, St Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Ave, Central Park etc etc. Near subway stations so the entire island is within easy reach. The staff were welcoming and accommodating. My luggage did not arrive for 2 days so they did everything possible to help me out and contact the airlines on a regular basis. The lobby is welcoming with coffee/spiced cidar to enjoy. 
The room was quiet and perfect. Comfy bog bed with chocolates nightly and Molton Brown bits in the bathroom. (very useful when you had zero luggage!). Lods of moveis to watch on your DVD player and a free newspaper every morning. Fantastic. 
I could not say enough good about this place. Will definitely be returning. :)
