We stayed at the Iroquois for 7 nights during our recent trip and was very impressed with the appearance and service offered at this hotel
It's a stones throw to most of midtowns attractions but is hidden enough it offers a great quiet spot to relax when pounding the streets gets too much
As previous reviewers commented on the small size of the rooms
I would agree but found it ideal for myself and my partner
It was clean
quiet
tidy and the large TV/ipod docking system were extra luxuries
The Molton Brown toileries
the nightly turn down service and the next day's weather card were also nice touches
We had a mini sensored refrigerator with a selection of snacks/drinks inside
(Don't knock anything over
) We requested for a mini fridge to store our own drinks in
and when they didn't have one available it was no problem
a porter was on hand to empty the minibar for us to use
The hotel wi
fi was also easy to access and reliable
The couple of small negatives for us were the small window looking into a brick wall therefore no natural sunlight in the room and we did twice have service staff in the morning opening our door if we didn't answer the doorbell within a second
That aside it really is a gem of a hotel and the service was of a high standard and we always greeted with a smile
I thoroughly enjoyed our stay
and wouldn't hestitate to stay again
