Upon arrival we where warmly greeted by staff
no issue with valet parking and check in was a breeze 
The room was smaller than we are used to
however after a few munities we adapted to the extremely clean and comfortable setting
The location is excellent and close to Grand Central and the park
A return visit is sure to come
