We spent 3 nights at the Iroquois New York and we very impressed
We were upgraded to a deluxe room which was extremely spacious for a New York hotel room
The decor was very tasteful and befitting of a boutique hotel
The staff we friendly and helpful
and Vanessa at concierge was amazing
very knowledgable and helped us out a lot when we were trying to find things like the post office and laundromats
The only negative was the shower
it could do with an update and the water pressure needs to be higher
We thought the pricing was fair
and will absolutely return to the hotel if we can get a similar rate in the future
this was my 3rd trip to New York and I found this hotel to be far better than others that I have stayed at in the past
the location is also very good
a short walk to Times Sqaure if you're that way inclined but far enough away to be away from the madness
very close to the subway
For those coffee lovers who can't bear the thought of drinking Starbucks
Stumptown Coffee is a 20 minute walk away at the base of the Ace Hotel at 18 West 29th St
in my opinion
far and away the best coffee in Manhattan
and for the caffeine addicted
well worth the walk
