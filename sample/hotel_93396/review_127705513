We enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois Hotel. Friendly, helpful staff, nice room, very nice bathroom. The king room was still a bit small. It is situated right around the corner from 5th Avenue and just a few blocks from Rockefeller Center. The block isnt too crowded, yet still always a taxi waiting right in front of the hotel. The concierge was able to make dinner reservations for us as well as order a car service for a dinner in Brooklyn. There is a small hotel bar, but it closes around 10 pm, even on weekends, which I thought was odd for Manhattan. There is another backroom 'Lamplighter" lounge that stays open about an hour later, however the drinks are crazy expensive. 
Only true issues I had with the hotel is that it has centrally controlled heat/air conditioning. We were warm both nights, and had no way to control it other than by opeing a window, which allows city noises in. The other is that is was a bit pricey, but afterall it is Manahttan.
