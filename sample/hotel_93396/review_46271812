We recently stayed here for part of our honeymoon
We found the rooms to be typical of any NYC hotel
cramped
Previous posts had suggested a recent renovation but the property appeared dated and worn
Worse
was the smell of the smoke that permated our room
An initial complaint resulted in the staff offering to spray our room to cover up the scent
We insisted on a room change that occurred promptly but still had a musty odor
Turndown service happened even though we had a "Do Not Disturb" on
In the end
I was happy to leave
