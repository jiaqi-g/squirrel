We came to the Iroquois on Columbus Day weekend
It has a terrific location being 2 blocks from Time Square and 2 blocks from Grand Central Station
The location to everything really made our stay enjoyable
The rooms are very small and you don't necessarily know what you are getting when you arrive
We booked out room well in advance
but when we got there we were put in a small room with a double bed
so small that with two of us
one person needed to stay in the bed while the other person dressed
We complained to management and they moved us to a queen room on the third floor which was great
also not that larger
but much roomier
and made the rest of our visit very enjoyable
The free internet is nice and wireless were great
It is right next door to the Algonquin Hotel which seemed like a nice place as well
The bed was amazing
very plush and wonderful
and the plasma tv was really nice as well
We'd stay here again
but we would want a guarantee of a queen room
