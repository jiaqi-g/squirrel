This was our second stay at this property. All of the hotel staff were welcoming and helpful. The concierge went out of her way to accommodate our requests ranging from limo service to tickets, dinner reservations, champagne and flowers, and recommendations for sighseeing. The hotel is small, intimate, and beautifully appointed - a wonderful, quiet space to come home to! Location is great for easy access to galleries, museums, shopping, and theatre.
