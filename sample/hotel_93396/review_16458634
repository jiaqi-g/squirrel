I took my mom to NYC for the weekend in celebration of her 70th birthday. My mom and I are not familiar with the City. The Iroquios Hotel staff was so attentive, helpful and patient with us. We were made to feel very comfortable and at ease. The hotel itself is very charming; there is a wonderful reading room at the front of the hotel. Our room itself was both beautiful and clean. 
I recommend The Iroquis highly to anyone visiting the City who is looking for a small hotel just a few blocks off Times Square and walking distance to the theaters!
