This is a really good hotel based two blocks from Times Square. My room was a "superior room" which included complimentary NYC times, shoeshine and turndown service. The main difference to a standard room seems to be the minibar. In my room it was a very stocked fridge, in a standard room, no fridge and minibottles just placed on a table.
Wireless phones, flatscreen TV, free WIFI internet and a good selection of spa products in the bathroom. 
The bed was a kingsize and extremely comfortable. 
You should be aware that rooms are far from silent, the a/c units outside makes a permanent noise which can be considered loud. I don't mind "white noise", actually I sleep better with it, but some in our party had a rough time adjusting to this.
