Our recent stay at the Iroquois was a delightful experience of elegantly decorated rooms
wonderfully friendly staff and an especially warm hospitality
The hotel General manager Mr Paul Celnik is always on hand for his excellent personal touch and attention to detail
This hotel will be our New York City home for years to come
