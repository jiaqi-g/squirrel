I recently stayed at the Iroquois with a friend. It's so difficult to find a hotel which offers 2 beds. The classic room at the Iroquois is ideal for 2 women traveling together. Although the room is small, it's very efficient. My only complaint is the bathroom which has very little room for toiletry storage and there is no fan so a shower will steam up the mirror. This is my fourth stay at this hotel and I think it's close to perfect. Times Square is so chaotic, noisy and crowded. Being close to 5th Ave, it's still an easy walk to theaters and even closer to the best shopping street in NYC. The room was ultra quiet and dark, and the bed was comfortable--all important components of a making me a happy guest. Unfortunately during our stay, one elevator was out of commission. I am sure the new one has been installed by now making the wait time up and down much faster. All in all, I am a loyal customer and high recommend a stay.
