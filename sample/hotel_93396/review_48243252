We enjoyed our stay at the Iroquois. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel doesn't have a parking garage but there is one right across the street. We didn't need to use the car during our stay, we walked everywhere. It was our first time to New York City and were very surprised. The city is much cleaner than we expected. We are looking forward to going back. We had a great meal at the restaurant in the hotel.
