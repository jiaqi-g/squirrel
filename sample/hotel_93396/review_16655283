I have been to The Iroquois Hotel before when visiting New York on business
so when my husband asked me to book a hotel for our weekend get away I decided to go there
And what a good decision it was: this hotel is charming
from the welcoming staff
to the check in
to the gorgeous rooms and the beautiful marbled bathrooms ( and have I mentioned bath robes) to the chocolate on the pillows at night
and of course the bottled mineral water (complimentary ) on the table
The room is clean
quiet and spacious
and the beds and linens are great
even at home we don't sleep so comfortable
And since it was rainy that day
an umblrella was waiting for us when we went for a walk
The hotel is very well located
close to Broadway and also to 5th Avenue
and it was easy to just walk everywhere
There are also some great restaurants in the neiburhood
Even the town car the hotel booked for us to return to the airport was a pleasant experience
We are hoping to return to this hotel and we are very happy to recommend it to everybody
