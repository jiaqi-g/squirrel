This hotel was nice but i would not stay here again
the rooms are very small even compared to NYC standards but the most surprising thing is that there is NO vanity or anywhere to place cosmetics and hair dryer
curling iron while getting ready which I think is quite important
The concierge was very nice and so was most of the front desk staff
Sharing the small elevator with the days trash
was not exceptionally "fun"
Personally for the same price I would stay next door at the Sofitel
Bed were very comfortable and hotel was clean
