I have worked for many years for a well know luxury hotel company and am particular when it comes to hotel rooms. I must say I was a little nervous about checking into to this boutique hotel as these type of hotels can go either way in NYC. This boutique hotel exceeded my expectations from the pleasant front desk agent to the concierge who we did not utilize though ever time we were in the lobby I could over hear him assisting guests in well educated pleasurable manner. We had an incredible nice size suite on the 11th floor with hard wood floors in the living room (love that) and a beautiful bedroom with a king size bed with a surplus of pillows! The room was nice and clean!!! The bathrooms were all marble tiles with Molton Brown amenities (two thumbs up) and a plethora amount of Frette towels and luscious (2) Frette bathrobes. In Room Dinning provided timely service. All the employees were engaging and friendly. The only thing I was disappointed about was that I could not stay longer. Great hotel and I would highly recommend!!
