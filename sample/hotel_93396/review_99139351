My husband booked us rooms in March '11 for a weekend getaway and we could not have been more pleased
The price was reasonable (approx $145 per night)
the location was great and the staff and room were perfect
The room was small but certainly not tiny
it had a large comfy bed
large dresser with flats screen and a nicely sized bathroom where both of us easily got ready for a night out
Renovations were apparently done in 2006 and it shows
There was a small work desk in the room
this would have been difficult for me to work at had I been there for business
However there is free wifi in the hotel and a beautiful library overlooking the street so if I had been working I would have gone down there
What impressed me most was the small things
there was hot tea and coffee in the lobby at night and the morning
The concierge was friendly and helpful with dinner recommendations one night
There were soft bathrobes for us in the bathroom and chocolates waiting for us at night on the pillows
In the morning there was a newspaper and a card with a weather report for the day
They offered 24 hour room service and a number of restaurants in the area delivered
We weren't staying with kids but they offered all children there choice of bubble bath and small bathrobes to match there parents
It was walking distance to all theaters and a number of great restaurants that ranged in price and cuisine
Overall we would highly recommend it and plan to stay there again in the future
