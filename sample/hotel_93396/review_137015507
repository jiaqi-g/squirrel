Bottomline is that this is a 3
star hotel advertised as a 4
While the staff is generally nice and competent
the whole experience at the hotel falls short
For e
there is no room service on Sundays
breakfast is subpar
I wont stay here again and will switch back to the Grammercy Park as my choice hotel in NYC
