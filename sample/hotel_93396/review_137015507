Bottomline is that this is a 3-star hotel advertised as a 4-star. While the staff is generally nice and competent, the whole experience at the hotel falls short. For e.g. there is no room service on Sundays, breakfast is subpar, etc. I wont stay here again and will switch back to the Grammercy Park as my choice hotel in NYC.
