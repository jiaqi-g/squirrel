I booked our stay more than 3 months prior to arrival
booking a small suite
I was called a few days before my arrival and asked to relinquish my suite
The excuse they gave smelled fishy
but I decided to be a good guy
I told them they needed to give me 2 adjoining rooms because I had a 10 year old daughter traveling with us
I stressed that the rooms must be adjoining
We tried to gain access to our rooms at 3 p
and we were told that only one room was ready
that there was still a guest in the other room
At 6:30 p
the "guest" was still in the other room
My requests to speak with a manager were dismissed
although he was on
We overheard the staff discussing the fact that some investor's brother had the room and had left the hotel without removing his luggage and they didn't want to bother him by removing his luggage
Finally
they moved the luggage out at 7 p
The rooms could hardly be considered adjoining
You had to cross a small hallway between them; there was a door between the hallway and the rest of the hotel with no more than a bathroom door lock on it
The next morning at breakfast we overheard the manager with his guests at the next table
and we surmised we had been bumped from the suite to accommodate the manager's daughter
her cousin and his inlaws
DO NOT TRUST THIS HOTEL
THEY PUT EVERYONE AHEAD OF THE THIRD PARTY PAYING GUESTS
