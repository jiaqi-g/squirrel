Second time staying here for Christmas shopping weekend in New York
Our room was a little more cramped than I remember and the lift seemed slower than before
but I do love the hotel
Nothing is too much trouble for the staff and the location is absolutely ideal
The plusses are the great staff
lovely cocktail bar and delicious and perfect Eggs Benedict in the restaurant; the negatives are the slightly cramped library (only has seating for around four people)
the cocktail bar was closed on Sunday night and the two lifts are really slow
I would however still recommend this as a great little boutique hotel in a perfect location
