We loved our stay at the Iroquois. The staff is very helpful and friendly...giving great recommendations for restaurants and how to get around. We booked through a 3rd party, who did not notify the hotel that there would be 2 people staying in our room. The front desk offered an upgrade to a larger room, without us having to ask. Bill was really helpful, he gave us great suggestions for dinner, took care of our luggage and secured us a car for our trip to the airport while we did our last minute shopping. The hotel is clean, friendly, nicely decorated and in a great location. We'd definitely stay here again.
