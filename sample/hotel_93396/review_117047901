I found this Boutique Hotel a few years ago, and whenever I go to New York City, this is where I stay. The people are just wonderful ! Venassa, the concierge, was very helpful. The rooms are outstanding. What else can I say. The Hotel is in a great location. Near the theatre district, Time Square, Rockefeller Centre. I can say only good things about The Iroquois Hotel. They my stay in New York City that much better !!
