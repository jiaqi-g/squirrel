Even though this hotel has the tiniest lobby I've ever seen, I really enjoyed staying here. The rooms were comfortable and the location was also really good. Walked to Times Square one evening for a play, the walk to Central Park was a bit further afield but we made it in the end. New York is really a walking city and the location is hard to beat. Good value for money as well. Also free wi-fi, which is a major plus for me!
