The Iroquois Hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel
with a perfect location in midtown
From the time we arrived we were warmly welcomed and greeted by their friendly staff
from the doorman
to the front desk staff and housekeeping
Every person we came in contact with at this hotel was genuinely kind and made us feel so very welcomed
The concierge staff went above and beyond to find us theater tickets
and a wonderful pre
theater
3 course dinner at Le Cirque
and many other activities to enjoy during our stay
We cannot say enough good about this wonderful hotel
I have already shared our experience with many friends and work colleagues and will continue to share your praises
