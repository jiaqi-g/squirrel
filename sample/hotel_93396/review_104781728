My three day stay was delightful. Doorman, bellman, front desk, concierge, and last but never least, housekeeping, were excellent, professional, and FRIENDLY. No attitude and super service oriented. Clean, quiet, and very very comfortable--I had everything I wanted. Complementary extras were most thoughtful.
