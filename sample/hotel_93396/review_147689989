Stayed at this hotel for four nights in December 2012
It is perfectly located two blocks from Times Square and one block from Fifth Avenue
We found it a perfect base to explore all Manhattan has to offer
Walking to Central Park took approximately 20 minutes
Times Square was less than 5 minutes away and with close Subway stations access to all of Manhattan is a piece of cake
With regard the hotel itself
we were very happy with out choice
Location aside
the hotel was very clean and well appointed
We had a room on the 11th floor
and after sending the hotel an email prior to our arrival they provided a room with a view of the Chrysler Building
as requested
The room itself was a decent size
tidy bathroom with powerful shower and Molton Brown products
The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor
and we never had to wait for a lift
Both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous
as were the bell boys
A wonderful little touch was the urn in the reception area
In the morning it was full of coffee
with cups available for you to take out with you
And from the afternoon onwards
hot cider was available
Very happy with our choice and won't hesitate to return the next time we visit New York
