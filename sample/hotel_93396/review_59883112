I recently stayed at the Iroquois for a girlâ€™s trip with my sister
The price was competitive to other hotels in New York and it was located close to the Museum of Modern Art
which was our ultimate destination
The check in process was easy and the staff at the front desk was very friendly considering I was checking in at 12:35AM
We had probably the most basic room they offer with double beds
but it still had the most comfortable beds and bedding
We did get the complimentary turn down chocolates and a complimentary bottle of water
The room was spacious enough and it was a great home base for the weekend
The hotel was easy walking distance to the things we wanted to see
so the location was perfect
The best part of the trip was the concierge Nick
We had set out a very specific schedule of museum visits and plays and Nick was able to make reservations at great restaurants near each attraction
We had some of the best meals ever this time to New York and I know it is all because of Nick
A great meal is the culmination of a great day and Nick was able to deliver that
I will definitely stay at this hotel the next time I go to New York and would recommend it to others
