Everything about the Iroquois exceeded our expectations. The room is lovely and large for NYC standards. The bathrooms are well appointed, lovely towels, robes, etc. Beds were great. The service at the hotel was above and beyond - friendly, helpful and efficient. Breakfast excellent. The location of the Iroquois cannot be beat - walk to the theater, Central Park, Empire State, etc. After staying in several large and small hotels in midtown, I will be going back to the Iroquois.
