We stayed in the lovely room 500, which almost connects to one of the elevators. So easy was the access, in and out, that we did just that, came and went frequently. We used to stay at the Westbury, famous for its high-powered perfoming clients, but have switched to Iroquois because of its incredibly convenient proximity to the theater district and all the wonderful vibrance and life of the Times Square areas. We have found a new home in The City, where the staff seems like that in our own home.
