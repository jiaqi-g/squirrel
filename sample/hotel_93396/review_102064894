Visited NYC for a long weekend March 25-28 to visit kids, grandkids and a Broadway play. First time at the Iroquois and what a great place ! Staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but very clean and comfortable. Complimentary coffee and newspaper a class touch. The small library is a great place to wait for a spouse, visitors or just read a paper and/or check emails via two free-use computers.
 A real plus was the "quietness" from the Times Square madness but only two blocks away ! I plan on staying there next trip and would recommend it to anyone. 
(p.s....ask Eddie the doorman about the history of the street and next door Algonquin. You will be in for a treat from a great personality)
