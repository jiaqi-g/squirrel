We have just come back from spending six days at the Iroquois hotel in New York. This was our first time in New York, and for my mum, her first time abroad. We chose it after looking at the pictures on the hotel website and reading the details, which are exactly the same as what you get. I had booked it as a treat for my mum, taking her abroad and wanting something nice. The hotel was fantastic. Classy, clean and very warm and welcoming. The staff, as other people have said on here, are what really adds to this hotel. Friendly and pleased to help you. Sandra especially was great...helping us from day one.
Our room was a classic, which although wasn't huge, was very comfy, with a stunning marble bathroom and molton brown toilitries, which were regularly replaced. After a long day in the city, to come back and have our beds made and chocolates left on our pillow as part of turndown service, was great for us. Complimentary boot shining is also available.
It's a great location, close to town. Before we went we checked on this site and saw that people said there was a good diner a few doors away. Go there - much cheaper and very nice food. Everything from fruit to cooked breakfast.
There is a bar at the hotel, and a computer for guests to use - we used to email home and check flights - handy.
All in all, we would definietely go back! V. recommended.
