Loved the Hotel,staff were great,perfect location. Only problem was that the AC actually heated the room instead of cooling. Had to sleep with the windows open to try to cool it down. On the coldest setings it blew heated air. So I would not reccomend this hotel during the summer months.Besides that every thing was great.
