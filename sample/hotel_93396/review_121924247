Just as we were advised this is a stunning hotel.From the minute we arrived till we departed the staff were attentive and charming. Nothing was too much trouble and the room upgrade to a suite was fantastic.Superb location in the centre of Manhattan. The young lady conciege Venessa was so helpful. The restuarant and bar served fantastic food. We will return!
