This small but wonderful hotel is a a gem in the middle of the city. It is close to the theaters as well as the multitude of nearby restaurants plus it is a short walk from Grand Central Station. 
The doormen smile as do all of the staff at the desk. Each of them asks politely if there is anything more I needed and this place feels like a home away from home. The rooms are not large but very comfortable for a limited stay. I loved the king bed with large soft pillows and covers that wrapped around you. The housekeeping staff is efficent and caring. Even the chocolates on the pillow at night were delightful.
This is my favorite hotel in New York. You'll really like it if when you want comfort, smiles and a warm homey place to stay.
