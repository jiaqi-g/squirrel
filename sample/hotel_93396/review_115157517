I stayed here as a solo traveller over the Fourth of July weekend, 2011. The staff, especially the doormen/bellhops, were friendly and made me feel at home. My room on the 12th floor (top floor) was small and didn't have an enticing view, however, it was beautifully presented, clean and quiet. I was out most of the day and night, anyway, so the size and view weren't a big deal. A plate of choc-coated strawberries was a nice surprise on my first night, and a turn-down service with chocolates was offered on subsequent nights. 
Beware the electronic sensors in the room's mini-bar fridge. I stored my water bottles, which I'd bought elsewhere, in there, but the sensors indicated I'd *taken* two drinks. At check-out, I was not charged for the drinks after the guy at reception asked if I'd put any items *in* the fridge.
The internet connection was occasionally slow, and often my laptop would be directed to the Algonquin nearby. :) But for the most part, I could connect both my laptop and iPhone to the Iroquois easily. Best of all, it was free -- a welcome relief after paying $17 a day for this privilege at the Marriott Marquis on Broadway earlier on my trip.
I kind of had the sense that I was not alone in the room, especially when trying to get to sleep. But take that with a grain of salt as I've been watching a lot of ghost shows on TV lately.
Location-wise, it's great for those who want to see Broadway shows yet stay away from the neon and chaos of Times Square. It's still close enough to walk to theatres. I felt safe at all times, even late at night. Bryant Park is two blocks away, Grand Central Station, Radio City Music Hall and the Rockefeller Center are also close. I had the best-tasting hot dogs on the corner of Fifth and 46th. Pret-a-Manger, Jamba Juice and Crumbs (cupcakes) are good places to pick up some nibbles, but there are quite a few good restaurants nearby, too.
Overall, I loved my stay at the Iroquois and I'd go there again.
