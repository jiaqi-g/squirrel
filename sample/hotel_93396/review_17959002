This hotel was the perfect way to end a round
world trip
The location is sensational
right in midtown
5 minutes walk from Times Square
and Grand Central Station
Central Park is only 15 mins walk away
The staff here are so friendly
helpful and polite
Their welcome was gratefully received after a flight from London
Nothing was a problem for them
The room
while a little small
was beautiful
Flat screen TV
the largest minibar selection you could hope for
and the beds
I could rave about the beds here for hours
like sleeping on a cloud
relaxing
Three pillows to each bed
with luxurious linens
The bathroom was clad in marble
and spacious
With a bathtub
The service to the room was fantastic
quick and friendly
A point to note though
our room wasnt cleaned/beds made by housekeeping on our second day
until 3pm
I found that unusual
Maybe its common in NYC
My only true criticism of the hotel would be the door to our room
It rattled whenever the lift opened
or whenever another guest opened their room door
This was room 1001
No Fridge
but Ice is provided on request
or during the turn down service
A fantastic hotel for a little luxury in New York
and the most incredible sleep
Where can I buy one of those beds
