I am pleased to say that the Iroquois hotel is a wonderful place to stay
I have stayed in several Manhattan hotels and this small but luxury hotel has them beat
The staff was friendly and helpful from the moment we entered
The rooms were exceptionally clean and roomy
The king size bed was a little piece of heaven
The Frette linens made the bed one I wanted to take home with me
There was not a detail missed from the new flat screen televisions to the sparkling water in the refrigerator
Even the hotel bar and room service were exceptional
We had appetizers and drinks at the bar and Kasey the bartender was very attentive
He made suggestions and was right on
We also enjoyed breakfast in our room the following morning
The food was fabulous; they brought bacon and eggs to a new level
The GM Scott Geres cares about the guests at this hotel and definitely trains his staff to be the best
I highly recommend this hotel as a home away from home
