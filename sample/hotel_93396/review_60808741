We are literally just back from New York for our honeymoon
I am disappointed with the hotel for a number of reasons
Firstly I emailed them in advance and told them it was our honeymoon
so I was expecting a bottle of wine or flowers or some fruit in the room
but we received no acknowledgment when we registered
nor any nice touches
The room was 509 – which was at the back
I will start with the cons – sleeping was difficult because we were close to all the air conditioning units so they were noisy (even with ear plugs)
It was dark and the lighting was appalling
You literally had to go around to each light to turn them on with no overhead light or central switch
we found it really difficult to turn off the bedside lamps so I unplugged mine each night
The lighting was so bad that I couldn’t find anywhere to plug in the hairdryer and had to climb under the desk to unplug things
I later spotted a plug on the other wall
The furniture is too big for the room and a writing desk/chair is not needed
You can’t turn off the air con/heating it’s always on
but maybe that’s an American feature? 
The pros – the bed was great – new and very comfortable
The room was very clean and the location is a few blocks from everything
From Times Square
Grand Central Station
the subway
Bryant Park
oh and there’s a diner a few doors away which is great for breakfast
Free internet usage & water in reception was great too as our phones didn’t work and we had to make arrangements with various people
At Bryant Park there’s a lovely organic café called Le Pain Quotidien which had the best coffee (it’s hard to get a decent coffee in NY
) and delicious food
