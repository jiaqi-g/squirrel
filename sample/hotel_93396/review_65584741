I stayed at The Iroquois with my 17 year old daughter for 3 nights last weekend
I usually stay at The Warwick (which I love) but wanted to be closer to theaters as my daughter and I were going to four shows over the weekend
I recently stayed at the nearby The Muse (and liked it) but decided to try The Iroquois based on recommendations from TA
BAD DECISION
The Iroquois is my first BAD hotel experience in NYC after years of visits
My initial reaction to the hotel was disappointment
small lobby area
excrutiatingly slow elevators
and a miniscule room with virtually no daylight
I've heard about NYC hotel rooms like this but have never actually stayed in one before
I thought about upgrading our room but I found the hotel so depressing and uninviting that I knew we would spend as little time as possible in it so decided against it
Indeed
we left the hotel early each morning and returned late each night
But that was still too much time spent at the hotel as I woke up covered in clusters of red raised bites
I showed the hotel manager the bites and she immediately moved us to an upgraded room and assured me the hotel would investigate
A different hotel manager called me on my cell after I had checked out to inform me that the room was checked for bedbugs and the report was negative
He suggested that the bites might be mosquito bites but I told him that they were definitely not mosquito bites
the location
pattern and symptoms of the bites are most consistent with flea bites but could also be spider bites
He called me a few minutes later to say that he would comp one nights stay on my credit card (which he did but only the room rate and not the taxes)
I did not make a fuss about the bites other than requesting a new bed
The hotel management took the bites seriously
were very apologetic and responded quickly
However
despite their response
I will not stay at The Iroquois again as I've stayed at nicer midtown hotels which do not have bugs
The last thing I want to deal with during a short visit to NYC is getting bitten by bugs in a hotel bed
Too itchy
too icky
