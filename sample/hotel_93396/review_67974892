This was our second three nite stay at this Midtown charmer over the past couple of years
and as the last time
they didn't miss a beat
The Deluxe Rooms are lovely
spacious enough and very clean (thx Eilene)
with great 'Fretted' bed
But this hotel is as much about the service as anything
the ever courteous and helpful Front Desk
the spot
on dinner reservations by Concierge Angelic
with Concierge Nick nicely filling the balance
along with the always helpful Doorman Bill
The Fitness Room was highly functional and also very clean
with a hardly used new sauna
Only a few minutes walk from the Theater District
and while we normally spend most of our time south
it's a nice spot to launch from
and a nice retreat at the end of the day
While I could complain about the eternally slow elevators
it's now actually become a charming signature
Highly recommended (but don't tell anyone)
