This was our second visit to the Iroquois and it was an entirely different experience
We were regulars at the Algonquin but got tired of the problematic heating and AC and the fact that some rooms (and suites) are dogs for the money
notwithstanding the old hotel's historical charms
Friends had tried the nearby Iroquois so we gave it a try in 2003 and really loved it
We had an east facing room with a wonderful view of the Chrysler Buildling at night
We just returned (November 2004) and the second visit was a totally different experience
The room we were given (1107) was below a compressor that roared all the time
I wear a hearing aid but could hear the hum of the machine even with the aid off
We asked for a room change but was told the hotel was full but a change might be accommodated the next day
They did move us the next morning and the rest of our stay was more
less fine
a pipe broke and there was no hot water early Friday evening
and one of the two small elevators also stopped working and this created long waits trying to get out or back to our room in the company of other irritated patrons
The Iroquois (like the Algonquin) is an old building with limited capability to provide the amenities of more modern hotels
I don't know if we will go back or spend the extra $100 a night for a large room with working facilities
