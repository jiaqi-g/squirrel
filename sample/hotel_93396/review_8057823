My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 3 nights. We thought the hotel was a very good value at $300.00 a night for a deluxe room. The room was nicely decorated, very clean, and in great condition with flat screen wall mounted tv and very comfortable bed. The location couldnt be beat with only 2 blocks to Times Square. The staff was friendly and did everything imaginable to please. We did not like the pillows provided but when we ask for different pillows, two memory form pillows were quickly delivered to the room. The drawbacks are the size of the rooms and baths- they are small. The halls are narrow. There is not much to the lobby. There are two elevators and while they were a little slow we did not encounter any significant delays. We did find in our mini bar two opened and partially consumed beverages but they were removed promptly when we called the attention of the front desk. All in all a good experience.
