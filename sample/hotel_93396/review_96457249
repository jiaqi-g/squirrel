I challenge anyone to find a cleaner hotel in all of Manhattan. The rooms aren't large but are well furnished and the beds are very comfortable.
Located on 44th street near 6th Avenue there are 2 great restaurants next store, a deli 50 feet away, another coffee shop across the street and 2 banks on the corner. Whether you're going to midtown or Broadway, you are there. The elevators (there are 2), are fast and efficient. 
This is just a great place. Don't hesitate to stay here.
