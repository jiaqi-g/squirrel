Located in Manhattan's Heart
it may look small from the outside
but it is compensated by the excellents staff
and the luxury of every room
You can walk to the rock from here
or even timesquare
without spending too much time
And if you have a specific need for tickets or any information
the concierge it's alway avaliable and knowledgable so you do not have to worry about anything in the big apple
except of enjoying every single minute
