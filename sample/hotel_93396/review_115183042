We discovered the Iroquois several years ago
and its always our first pick for trips to New York
We love the rooms
and although small
are furnished and decorated very upscale
and very comfortable
The hotel is very near Broadway shows
but far enough that you don't feel like you are in the midst of the hustle and bustle
You are also only a short walk from 5th avenue
Bryant Park and Grand Central
Try the Triomphe for an excellent pre
theater dinner
and we like the Red Flame just a few doors down for breakfast
