Stayed 3 nights
Had requested late arrival and was greeted warmly by name at 1:30 AM
The room
on the 11th floor was small
probably under 150 square feet
But the room was superb: the bed
linens
the decor all elegant
understated
and gracious
Ipod dock in the room
free wi
door hung NY Times were all small touches that just put the place over the top for us
Very friendly staff
Great location: Times Square
Rock Center
Broadway
and Grand Central were all within easy walking distance
Ploenty of high end restaurants and bars within a block; there's a decent Greek diner 3 doors up (The Red Flame) for comfort food breakfast in AM
We got the room on reward points
so it had no view and I know we were in one of the smaller rooms
But hey
if you're going to New York to hang out in your room
something's wrong anyway
Would absolutely recommend this small luxury hotel to everyone
