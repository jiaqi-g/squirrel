Our stay was highlighted by an extremely courteous staff, particularly the front desk and doormen, who assisted with our luggage. (My family does not travel light as we arrived with a large double jogging stroller, bicycle and many pieces of baggage). The amenities were fabulous as the room we stayed in featured a large flat screen television and IPOD dock/alarm clock. 
The staff made my 3 year feel like she was a princess in her own castle. 
I highly recommend this establishment to anyone visiting NY on business or pleasure.
