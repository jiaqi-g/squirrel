Nice hotel
Got a good rate at 220 a night
Was here for play and broadway
Location is very good so good that cab driver refused to take us to play which was only two blocks away
Room is small especially bathroom but it's the trade off for being in the city
Parking garage across the street
Clean room with modern decor
No noise with the exception of a loud rude guest who was talking loudly in hallway at 5 am
Did not try hotel resturant because I didnt see anything I wanted but tripadvisor reviews are good
One flaw was I asked housekeeper who was in hallway for additional flat sheet and she replied to call later and that there was not any
I did call later in the evening and was promptly brung up
For the convience of being close to time square and broadway at the same rate I would stay here again
