The Iroquois is a very nice small hotel right off 5th Avenue but away from a lot of the street noise. The lobby is small but charming and has a small library with two computers for guest use. The staff is very friendly, and coffee is always available at the entrance. The rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. After all, when you are in New York, you aren't in your room very much, so it really doesn't matter if it's small. We did have somewhat of a view of the patio with tables and chairs of the building next door, so at least we didn't have a brick wall two feet outside our window, which we have had in Mahatten hotels before.
