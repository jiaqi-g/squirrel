I have stayed at the Iroquois several times, and it's always the same lovely, cozy hotel, in a fantastic location, with luxurious but minuscule rooms and bathrooms. Elevators are terribly slow, staff is a little forgetful, but mostly friendly and helpful. Coffee is available in the lobby in the morning hours.
