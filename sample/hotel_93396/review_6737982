Loved this hotel. Clean, comfortable, attractive rooms. Room was small, like so many in large cities, but not overly so and very comfortable. Loved the 36 inch flat screen TV with DVD player.Could kick back at night and watch my favorite movies. Wonderful staff. Incredible location. Within walking distance of so much. Will definitely stay there again.
