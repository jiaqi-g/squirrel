We stayed at the Iroquois in a deluxe room for seven nights in April
We had a nice bright room at the front of the building overlooking 44th street; it was adequate in size for two people but not overly spacious
(could have done with more hanging space) although the bathroom was quite large and supplied with Molten Brown toiletries
The rooms were kept very clean and the bed was so comfortable
with good quality bed linen
A nice touch was the chocolates and weather card for the next day being left every night along with the bed being turned down
We would recommend having the continental breakfast in the hotel it is a reasonable price and much better than the Red Flame Diner down the block
There is more than enough to eat
with a choice of cereals
fruits
salmon
cold meat
cheese
yoghurts
pastries and bagels
There is a computer with free access to the internet in a room to the left as you come into the hotel
although this broke down a couple of times the hotel were quick to get it fixed
We found the staff to be polite and extremely helpful
The hotel was really nice and in the ideal location
very central for Broadway
Times Square
5th Avenue shopping
Central Park
Bryant Park a great place to people watch
Grand Central Station and the Public Library on 5th
which are two
must see buildings
There is a wonderful patisserie called “Le Pain Quotidien” on 40th street across from Bryant Park for sandwiches
cakes
coffee etc
Also worth a visit are Woodbury Common shopping outlet for lots of bargains
get the bus from the Grey Line bus station
Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island is another great day out; The Top of the Rock observation deck at the Rockefeller Centre has better views than the Empire State
get there for sunset
Restaurants we would recommend are Michael Jordan’s in Grand Central Station good food and the cheesecake is huge
Ben and Jack’s Steakhouse on 219 E 44th St
Trattoria Trecolori Italian restaurant at 254 W 47th St
good food at affordable prices
We found the best way to get from Newark airport to Manhattan was by taxi
the cost was approx $60 and it was far quicker than the shuttle bus which we had used previously
