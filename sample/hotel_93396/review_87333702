I was recommended this hotel by a friend who worked for Small Luxury Hotels.. It is a great location, just off Times Square so was well within walking distance to everything but was just far enough away that we didn't hear any noise at all. 
I stayed in the room with my Mum, so had two queen sized beds, which were really comfortable. Room was a tiny bit small but this is to be expected in NYC.
This hotel is really reasonably priced, more the price of a 3 star than a 4 star and I could not recommend it any higher. I would not hesitate to stay there again.
Also loved the Red Flame diner down the road for breakfast, in fact we went there everyday!
