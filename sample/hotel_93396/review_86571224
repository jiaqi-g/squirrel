The Iroquois was beautiful
the first thing that comes to mind is the clean white rooms
The beds were deliriously comfortable and warm
The staff was friendly if distant
and there was always hot coffee/cider depending on the time of day
Midtown location was convenient to many things
but the road its on seemed to have mostly other hotels
but don't take my word
I don't remember quite clearly
The view out the window was only to see other hotel rooms through a small alley
The lobby and sitting area were both smart
cozy and classy
in fcat the whole place was cozy and classy
a great wintertime hotel in New York
