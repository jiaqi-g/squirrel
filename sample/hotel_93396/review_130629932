This is a nice boutique hotel in Manhattan within easy walk of most Midtown destinations such as 42nd Street, Grand Central and Times Square.
The hotel room was surprisingly spacious, clean and confortable. Check in / check out was efficient and hastle free, plus they have free Wifi. Complimentary coffee served in the lobby during the mornings, and the neighbouring bar was smart and comfortable. Breakfast is pricey but a short walk out of the hotel to the right, there is a convenient diner offering an array of breakfast favourites at reasonable prices.
