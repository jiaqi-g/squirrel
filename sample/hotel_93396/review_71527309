This is a lovely boutique hotel. We had a mis-understanding over our room booking that we only found out about 9 days before our trip. This was down to a hotel member of staff giving us incorrect information regarding the amount of people the rooms we had booked could accomodate. When we discovered that only 4 of our family of 5 had sleeping accomodation, it put me into a bit of a panic! After a few emails then some person to person calls to Tirtzah in reservations, we managed to upgrade one of the rooms to a suite, which was fantastic, so many thanks to her for helping to sort this out before we arrived. The stay in the hotel was great, staff were friendly, especially the concierge staff, who recomended the 3 day hop on/off bus package which allows you to choose from 3 other attractions eg Top of the Rock, Empire, among many others. With this pass we did the loops inc the night loop over the Brooklynn Brigde- great, we choose the Twighlight Water Cruise- fantastic, you get to see the city skyline lite up, really lovely. We also choose Top of the Rock, again good and Ripley's Believe it or Not- just ok. This cost $109 PP, which was we felt good value in all. This hotel is in a central position which allows you to get your bearings well. The complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and the chilled water with fresh fruit in it (heatwave!), was a nice touch. There are nice places in NYC to eat and some good ones close around. Try breakfast in Pershings, just under the bridge at Grand Central- get a booth if you can and get the pancakes- fantastic. If going back to NYC, I would stay in this hotel again, the staff, location and great condition of this hotel make it a great place to stay.
