Here's what I experienced this past week after staying 6 nights with a friend from abroad:
the good ...
great central location for tourists and business; beds extremely comfortable - both mattress & linens; charming small intimate old style hotel; friendly & helpful staff; free wi-fi throughout and/or use of (2) computers in library near front door; elegant restaurant on premises for breakfast, lunch, or dinner; free 24 hr gym with newer cardio equipment, dry sauna, & whirlpool bathtub; free NYTimes at each guest rm; automatic turndown service with milk chocolates; molton brown toiletries; in room safe; large flat screen TV; Frette bathrobes & linens.
the bad ... 
only 1 small elevator working for this 12+ floors & took a week for the other broken elevator to be fixed and back in use, so had to share with maintanence, housekeeping, rug/renovation repairmen, guests, suitcases, room service, management; very expensive ($400) for 1 queen bed in small room and no discount or special amenity offered to compensate for broken elevator; no slippers provided automatically - had to ask for pair - perhaps this is less wasteful? One employee had breath that smelled like alcohol in morning - not a good impression / professional. Toiletry item 'disappeared' from outer pocket of my backpack that I stored with concierge on day of checkout-departure. Wi-fi reception inconsistent in room. Rooms dark visually due to heavy large dark furniture and furnishings in room including dark window blinds and lamp shades (not opaque) directing light downward ...no ceiling light ... so even during the day the room was a bit dark for reading/computer work. Gym small & limited, but better than most hotels of similar size.
