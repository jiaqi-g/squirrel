Stayed one week here (Oct
Hotel is very accomodating with regards to our request of having a room in the higher floors
refrigerator in the room and a late check
The cleaning staffs are particularly recommendable
The hotel has a system on tipping wherein they leave envelope in the room for you to put your tip
There were 2 incidents when they must've forgotten to leave the envelope therefore
we put the money on the dressing table but we found it still there when we got back
Size of the room is big enough to walk around comfortably even with luggage lying around
The air condition is a little loud but did'nt hinder us from having a good sleep with the cozy bed and pillows and Frette linens
The free morning coffee and evening apple cider was a blessing especially during cold days
We had the bed and breakfast package which we regretted because the continental breakfast took forever to be served and choices are limited
Besides
there's a diner just few doors down the hotel which gives you value for your money and more choices too but get there early on weekends because the place fills up quickly
But dinner at Triomphe Restaurant (same place where they serve breakfast) is a different matter
the ambience
the service and the food is excellent all the way
cannot comprehend why breakfast and dinner have 2 different standards
The location of this hotel is just perfect
within walking distance of lots of sights and MTA station and yet on a quiet and safe street
