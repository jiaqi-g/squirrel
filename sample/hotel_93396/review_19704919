On arrival at the hotel we were a little concerned as we saw work going on in the lobby but this turned out to be refurbishment (quiet) and not at all a hindrance
The staff were very friendly and the hotel boosted a real customer focus feel
The room was excellent
There was a large flat screen tv
Molten Brown products in the bathroom
chocolates on the pillow and the bed was very comfy
The room and bathroom was very clean with an excellent shower
The only thing I would say was that the they were both a wee bit small but this was overlooked at the level of service we recieved
Complimentary newspapers followed each morning
The location was superb
10 mins walking distance from Times Square and the Subway
It would have been nice to have more than 1 PC in the library as there were times we needed to check things and the PC was being used but the concierge did a fantastic job of filling in the gaps
Room service was always prompt
however be careful when asking for laundary to be done as they stapled into our tops twice
On the whole
we will certainly be going back to stay at this hotel next time we are in NY as it was an extremely comfortable and pleasant experience
However
when you book a cab from the hotel
always go with the Yellow Cabs because the unmarked taxis charge 40% more at times and some of them are not licensed and insured to carry people
Do not let the door people talk you into using them
A great great stay
