The Iroquois, like many NYC hotels, has small rooms. Don't plan on putting your suitcase on the floor! However, what it lacks in space, it makes up for in amenities. Rooms are comfortable with DVD players, wireless, etc. The library was a pleasant lobby space to quickly check email, print boarding passes, or enjoy the morning coffee or afternoon lemonade. The book collection is fun to browse-- many tomes on NYC. The staff was extremely polite and friendly. The location can't be beat.
