I booked the Iroquois for 5 nights in April. I chose this hotel for its location and the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. 
When we arrived we were greeted by the concierge who helped with our luggage. He was very polite and told us to find him if we have any questions/queries.
The room was very small but expected in New York - it was nicely decorated and very clean.
This didn't bother us as we would only be using the room to sleep in as we wanted to explore NY as much as possible. It would have been nice to have tea and coffee facilities in the room.
The Iroquois is located right near times square/theatre district. It was great to just be able to walk home most nights. 
The bar and restaurant is expensive but good food if your willing to pay the prices. There are some great Italian restaurants further down the street on the left hand side.
The iroquois is ideal for a short stay and a perfect spot for sightseeing.
