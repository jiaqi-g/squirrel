Booked the iroquois after some lengthy research thru Trip Advisor and glad we stayed at this hotel. Location was excellent, 2 mins from Times Square and the staff were exceptionally friendly and informative when needed. I opted to go for a higher standard hotel due to my elderly mother coming with us and that she would be comfortable staying in the hotel if she didn't feel fit enough to walk all day. The rooms were well presented, very comfortable and very clean. We were given 2 rooms at the rear of the hotel - myself and my wife and a twin room for my mother and daughter - these had no view but we weren't in the rooms for long.
Didn't eat in the Hotel Restaurant, although I wish we had instead of the Marriot View in Times Square, worst, most expensive buffet I've ever had in my life. Seriously, it might have a nice view, Star Trek type elevators - 47 floors in seconds, revolving floor area but give this a miss.
Only negative I had was to walk past umpteen bars to go for a birthday drink in the Hotel Bar only to be told I needed to reserve a table in the bar, I didn't understand that one?
I'd recommend this Hotel if your planning to stay and would use it again.
