My husband and I spent 5 nights at this charming mid town hotel..loaded with luxury amenities at an affordable price, right in the heart of town. Brass fixtures, minibar, free wi-fi in each room, plush, comfortable bedding, robes, and flat-screen TV are just some of the in-room highlights. Complimentary coffee in the lobby each morning and each afternoon there was a refreshing chiiled urn of cold iced citrus water, and considering the heat wave that was a definite plus! Small reading library in the lobby with computers and printers (so you can print out your own boarding passes, and a great little bar and restaurant..we will definitely stay at Iroquois on all future trips!
