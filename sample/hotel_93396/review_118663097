this hotel is great
We chose from the Small Luxury Hotels chain to celebrate a special birthday with a week in NY
The hotel surpassed everything we expected
We got a friendly welcome
an amazing room (the suites are very spacious) with everything we needed and more
Nothing was too much trouble for the staff
The bed was bliss
It was steps from Times Square but on a peaceful street
if there is such a thing in NY
We never once heard noise from our neighbours
even though the hotel was full
The Concierge was extremely helpful
helping us to book tickets for the ball game
Broadway
a comedy show and a show at the Lincoln Centre
If you really want to spoil yourself then book this place
Its fab
