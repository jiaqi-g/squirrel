My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois hotel this past weekend for one night
It was a lovely experience
The location of this hotel in the theater district is perfect
It’s less than two blocks from Times Square
and it’s in walking distance from most of the theatres and surrounding restaurants
A big plus
the Iroquois is located directly across from the Hippodrome parking garage
Have the hotel validate your parking ticket and you’ll pay a discounted rate
For these reasons
we will definitely stay here again when we go to another show on Broadway
We reserved a CLASSIC room through American Express Travel
We got a much better rate compared to the hotel and other travel website rates
The room was nicely decorated
clean
yet very small
There is a large HD Flat screen television on the wall and desk in the room
For a short stay
it’s perfect
We were assigned to room 300
on the third floor
The view from the windows is towards a small alley/courtyard
Not pleasant to the eye
but it has its advantages
The room is not subject to most of the street noise
We were actually quite impressed how quiet it was
We heard a few horns hear and there
most likely from the cars that are exiting the parking garage
The hotel locked up our luggage after checkout
and held it for hours till we left the city
The hotel staff were friendly and helpful
The only complaint I have with this room is its’ location within the hotel
It’s directly next to and across from two elevators
I also believe there is housekeeping quarters nearby
So we heard every person coming and going
as well as doors opening and closing
Since its low season
we did not find this as bothersome
but I can imagine it would be if the hotel was full
You can hear conversations right through the door loud and clear; as they can hear yours
For this reason
I could not give it the highest rating
but I would stay here again
I would recommend requesting a room further away from suites 300
303 if you are assigned to any of them
TIP: try the diner next to the hotel for cheaper
delicious breakfast
