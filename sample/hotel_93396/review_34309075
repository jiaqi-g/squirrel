The iroquois is a very nice place to stay - we enjoyed this place. It is very close to Times Square and all the activitites - though still pretty quiet in the room. We slept soundly every night in a king size bed. The bathroom was nicely decorated and functional. The room was smallish with no real view to speak of. The service for ice always was brought quickly - we asked for a small bar fridge and used that to cool fruit and water. Trivial quibblings - two slower elevators - though we rarely waited long and a small closet. Great coffee and iced tea free in the lobby. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. We did not eat in the hotel. The first day here we bought a hop on, hop off 48 hour bus pass which worked well for us - we used the downtown and up town tours to get around on the longer routes. The busses come often - we never seemed to be waiting. We are avid walkers and walked most everywhere from the hotel, from Macy's to Sak's to Sardi's, to our play and around Times Square in the evening hunting for a place to eat. I walked out of a well known chain restaurant in Times Square because food and drink prices were not provided in the menu - we noticed this a couple of times - though smaller places seem to be more sensible. Central Park was a bit far to walk - we took the hop on/off and rented bikes for the park - this was a nice 1/2 day outing.
