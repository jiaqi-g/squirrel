We spent six nights at the Iroquois and would have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone.
As arranged a car was there to meet us at Newark Airport even although our flight was delayed. All members of staff we encountered during our stay were professional and helpful. Our (superior) room was well appointed and most comfortable. We enjoyed dining in Triomphe - a high standard of cuisine and a high level of service.
To top it all, the location is ideal for visitors to New York.
