We stayed at the Iroquois for 4 nights and truly enjoyed our stay.
Major plusses: outstanding, staff - every shift, every area. We could not have asked for more attentive, professional yet unobstrusive people.
Location is terrific: just off 6th Avenue; near Times Square; just around the corner from the NY Public Library (well worth a visit for its fine exhibits); yet completely quiet.
Room was plenty large; bathroom also had plently of space. Here was the only hiccup: not much storage space in the BR. But the shower is terrific - comfortable with plenty of hot water.
We'd had dinner at the Iroquois a few years ago. We travel to NYC every year or so: we'll return to this hotel without hesitation.
