We had high expectations of this hotel and were disappointed with our first room, which was very small, and was clearly not designed for a queen bed (which it though had - we had booked the queen sized room). We raised this the following morning and were moved without argument at all. Our second room was a much better size - although still not huge, but I get the impression mid-town NYC hotel rooms are generally smaller. Our second room was a decent sized room and good standard. 
It's a nice, smaller hotel. It's got the right "feel" for a four star place, although it being a city hotel, you're probably not going to be amazed - unless you spring for a suite. 
The gym was of a reasonable size, and location is fine - really close to everywhere, but that's also a negative for some ... keep in mind it's close to Times Square - which is more than a little touristy (it's not too close though - a few blocks). 
Final bit of advice: don't drive here ...
