We stayed here for one week after Hurricane Sandy
and although we are New Yorkers
this was a lovely "Hurricane Vacation"
While our room was small
it was well appointed
comfortable and quiet
The staff was exceedingly helpful with all our needs
and the hotel is perfectly situated for all that Midtown and Broadway has to offer
