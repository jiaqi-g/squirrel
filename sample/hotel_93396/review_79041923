Very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent location between times square and 5th ave. Clean room, comfortable bed, turn down service with chocolates was very nice as was the Molton Brown toiletries. The only downside was the room didn't have a great view but not really a problem when all the sights are only a few steps away.
