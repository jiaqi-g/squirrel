Quick stop in NYC for shopping and shows between Christmas and New Year's. 
Incredible staff did it again, exceeded our expectations. We arrived early, and they got us into rooms due to our, ahem, minor emergency. My daughter had a shampoo bottle explode in her luggage, covering everything. Nick, the new concierge, took over at that point. He got everything to a local laundry, with wash and fold service and it was back by dinner time. The housekeeping staff steam cleaned or power washed the suitcase, and all was fine before we headed out to the theatre. Rooms are cozy, but always comfortable. So comfortable in fact, that getting up the next morning proved difficult.
Kudos too to the staff at Triomphe for their excellent service, fantastic food and extra special care when I needed to send a bottle of Champagne to some guests we had just met.
As we checked out the next day, our luggage was stored (no charge, which is nice) as we had a late flight out that night. After a full day of shopping, we re-sorted our bags in the Library, and were whisked to JFK airport by the hotel's limo service. Perfect from start to finish.
Really, it is my only choice for where to stay while in New York city.
