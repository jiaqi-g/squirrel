Everything about this hotel was outstanding. We arrived on a Tuesday afternoon, on vacation and were very quickly assisted by the bellman, then on to the front desk. This is a compact hotel, not grand, so if you're expecting that, this is not for you. Located on 44th St in Manhattan, it is literally close to everything we wanted to do: 9/11 Memorial, Ellis Island, Village Vanguard Jazz Club, ComedyCentral Club, Rockefeller Ctr, Strawberry Fields...etc. Very close to subway stations, Times Square, Broadway. The room was super-fantastic, beds were comfortable, sheets very luxurious, service was OUTSTANDING. The bath products Moulton Brown (very nice!). Join the Gold Club and receive a bottle of wine when you check in. I just can't say enough about this place, it's so quiet and classy. The bar downstairs made me a world-class special drink, the music was so nice too. I had a wonderful time and woul recommend this hotel, we got a good rate on booking.com.
