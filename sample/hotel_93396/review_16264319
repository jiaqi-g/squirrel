Last week I had the pleasure of staying in the Iroquois hotel New York
the service was excellent
from the moment I step in the hotel until I check out 2 days later
it felt like home and felt welcome with the warm smile of the front desk agent and the professional services of the bellman's
The room was very nice
clean and quiet
The mattress was very comfortable and soft
The restaurant was great
the food was unbelievable and the staff was very kind and friendly
The concierge was also very helpful
they helped me booked limo services
Broadway shows
In conclusion
the stay was unforgettable and I thanks to all the staffs who kindly made my trip a pleasant experience in my visit to New York
I will definitely recommended everyone to stay at the Iroquois hotel in New York City
