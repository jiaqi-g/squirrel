My husband and I stayed at The Iroquois for 3 nights in August during our first trip to New York. The hotel is conveniently located and we highly recommend it to future visitors. We stayed in a deluxe room with a king size bed. While the room may be comparably small, it is elegantly decorated and very clean. The hotel provides ample towels and fresh towels and chocolates are provided during a nightly turn down service. We will definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to New York.
