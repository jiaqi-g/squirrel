We had a wonderful stay at The Iroquois
The accomodations
staff
and restaurant were all excellent
The highlight of The Iroquois is their Concierge
Marga
Her assistance both before our trip and during our trip couldn't have been more valuable
She made numerous reservations for us
followed up when clarification was needed
and then made excellent recommendations on sites to see (or not to see)
restaurants
and Broadway shows
Not only is her knowledge of the city incredible
but she is an absolute joy to work with
The Iroquois is very fortunate to have her on their team
