Centrally located
not far from Times square and close to 5th avenue
The room was fresh and good
not large though
There was a tiny bar/restaurant in the hotel
but this was not very good in my opinion
Lacking almost everything at breakfast
for instance
There is a perfect breakfast place close by
so no worries
Can recommend for a trip for a couple or family
but a bit unpractical for larger group when the hotel itself has nothing to offer
