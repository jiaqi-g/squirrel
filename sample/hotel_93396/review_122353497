I spent some time researching where to stay in New York and chose The Iroquois mainly due to the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. From the minute we arrived, we knew we had made a great choice and were warmly welcomed by Patrick at Reception. The room was spacious, clean and well equipped. We had a fantastic view, fresh towels daily and turn down chocolates to return home to. Alan and Vanessa (the concierges) were exceptionally helpful; recommending restaurants and booking tickets for us. We felt thoroughly looked after for the entire of our stay. A great hotel, which I would most definitely recommend to all.
