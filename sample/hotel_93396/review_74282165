As a Gold Guest member, I called ahead of time and spoke to a Gold Guest Ambassador, to make my stay an ideal one. However, when I arrived and mentioned the ambassador's name, no one knew who I was talking about. I travel to NYC once a month and am used to the early check in process and the availablity. The front desk staff were curt, rude, and unaccomodating. They do not understand the concept of "estimated time" and seemed upset that I requested one. 
When I finally did receive a room, I was placed directly across from an elevator, which I specifically requested not to be. The air conditioner in the room was broken, so I was immediately moved to another room, right across from the elevator, again. When I mentioned the heat in the new room, I was told this is typical of the rooms, and had to request a portable fan be brought in. Even this did not help the uncomfortable temperature of the room. Nor did the engineer, who did not know how to properly work the air conditioner. 
As I was lying in bed, a hotel employee knocked on the door, did not wait for an answer, and proceeded to let himself in. 
The fixtures in the shower and lack of ease were a clear indication that this hotel needs to be updated. 
There are always great deals for hotels, but I would gladly spend the extra money for a hotel that provides a nice experience. This hotel is not even worth the discounted price, especially when there are much better ones within walking distance. this was definitely a lesson learned.
