We had two nights booked at the Iroquois for July 26-27. We arrived on Saturday night to check in and were told that some pipes had burst in the hotel and they could not accomodate us for the first night of our stay. They had secured a room across the street at the Royalton. The manager explained that we would stay there, then come back in the morning, have a free breakfast and they would upgrade us to a nicer room for the second night of our stay. While this was an inconvenience, I couldn't argue with the reason. The manager explained that he had spent the day scrambling to find available rooms in other hotels. We checked into the Royalton across the street and had a nice evening there. The room was fine, if a little dark. the decor there is more industrial chic than the Iroquois. The next morning, we walked our luggage across the street and checked into the Iroquois. They gave us the James Dean Suite: a huge living room with hardwood floors and lovely furniture. The attached bedroom was very nice. We had a free continental breakfast in their dining room. Throughout our stay, the assistant manager, Antonio, kept asking us how our room was and apologizing for the night before. We felt like royalty! The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We will definitely make it a point to stay at the Iroquois again. They handled a potential disaster with the poise that you would expect for this caliber hotel. Even if they had not upgraded our room, I'm sure I'd be saying the same thing.
