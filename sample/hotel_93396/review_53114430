We stayed in the Iroquois for five nights as part of our honeymoon and we loved every minute of our stay
The staff were very helpful
friendly and courteous
Our room
while small (as most New York hotel rooms are) was extremely comfortable and the furnishings of a very high standard
The frette linens made the bed one of the most comfortable I can honestly say we have ever slept in
The bathroom was pristine and the Molton Brown products which were replenished daily were very luxurious
The hotel was very central but located far enough away from Times Square that you felt removed from the touristy zone
A special word of thanks to the Concierge Nick who was most accommodating when helping us make our dinner reservations
We would return here without any reservation at all and highly recommend it
