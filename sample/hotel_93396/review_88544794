My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights for Thanksgiving weekend and enjoyed our stay
We didn't require a full service
lavish hotel as we want to spend time out in the city
Iroquois (booked via Expedia) fit the bill as a is nicely styled hotel in a fabulous location
Pros:
Comfortable room (but small
usual for NYC) with modern amenities
Comfortable bed and sheets
Restaurant was very good for dinner (but quiet and uncrowded)
Convenient
blocks to major subway lines to easily get uptown or downtown
Blocks to Times Square
Rockefeller Center and other major mid town attractions
Helpful staff
Drawbacks:
Avoid room 304 as it is next to the fitness center; we were awakened around 4 or 5 in the morning by pounding on the treadmill and subsequent rattling from a loosened air vent
No lobby bar or much of a lobby (go next door to Algonquin Hotel Oak Room or across street to Royalton)
Lobby music
Brass appointed bathroom
hello 80s
