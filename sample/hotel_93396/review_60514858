My wife and I have been to New York several times before
and every time we try a new place to stay
This time we went for the Iroquois
because of the excellent location and because we've stayed at some hotels of the Small Luxury Hotels Of The World before and they were always quite nice
Unfortunately I think the Iroquois is not quite up to those standards
The room was ok
maybe bit small
but hey it's NY
What put me off most of all was the dust on the mirror lamp in the bathroom
it seemed like it wasn't cleaned for at least a few months
They did clean it after I mentioned it
but still
Another thing I didn't like was the lack of doormen
most of the time there was nobody there
Nobody really showed any interest which would have been nice when we arrived with our cases
Oh and the elevators are slow and often busy
On the plus side
we had a nice dutch girl at reception who treated us really nice
The location is really good and the bed was good and free WIFI
which is a very good plus I think
All in all
it was a bit disapointing
Too bad for what could be a very nice hotel
