We had been searching for a hotel in New York for a long weekend in March
and one name kept coming up as available
The Iroquois
It seemed to be reasonably priced though well located
so perhaps there was a catch
we were pleased to find there wasn't
Situated just minutes walk from 5th Avenue
Times Square and numerous must
see places
the hotel could be used as a business stopover as well as a tourist base
Service was friendly at all times
and the facilities were clean and well
maintained
The rooms are not the huge size that is associated with many US hotels
but this is due to the nature of the building and its location
and is more than made up for in the character
The hotel restaurant is quite pricey
but there are so many good eateries within 3 blocks radius that you can always find somewhere to eat from breakfast to dinner
Highly recommended and will be looking to stay again on our next trip to the Big Apple
