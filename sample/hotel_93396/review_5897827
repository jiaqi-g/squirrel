We loved this hotel
We were attracted to the idea of staying in a smaller boutique hotel with character instead of some giant
boxy Marriott
like monster hotel
We certainly got what we were looking for and didn't have to sacrifice a great location to get it
It's within 2 blocks of Times Square but oddly we never heard a peep at night
We had been warned that you can't find a quiet hotel near the square
but we never experienced any noise issues
The staff was friendly and very attentive
We arrived at noon and our room wasn't quite ready but they were very helpful and apologetic
They offered to store our luggage which was fine because we were ready to get out and explore anyway
When we returned
we found a lovely bottle of wine and delicious chocolates compliments of the staff
The room was clean and bright and well
furnished
My favorite part however
were the bed linens
Unbelievable
Better than my own
The whitest
softest comforter and softest sheets
like sleeping on a cloud
And I think we had 6 pillows to choose from
The only negative about the room was a disappointing view of the fire escapes
but we got over it quickly
The other side of the hotel might have had a better view but probably more noise
The bathroom has floor to ceiling marble
very beautiful and VERY clean
Plenty of towels
GREAT water pressure in the shower
and wonderful
plush robes for your use
Seriously
I really felt like I was staying at a friend's house and not a hotel
It was great to have a warm
quiet
comfortable oasis and the end of a high energy day
We visited the bar a few times during our stay
The service was friendly and the house wines were excellent
I loved the decor
check out the pictures for yourself
Loved the little library in the front of the hotel with access to the internet
Is was great to be able to check email as we came and went
I would definately stay here again
Great place for couples
Go ahead and book it
