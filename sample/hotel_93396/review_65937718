My daughter and I stayed at The Iroquois 5/21-23 and everything was perfect. This was her first trip to NY and although I've visited many times, I must admit that my sense of direction is a little less than I'd like it to be. With that said, even though I looked at maps, I didn't really know where the hotel was until we got there and walked around a bit. The location was perfect! Close to the 42nd St theaters and hoopla of Times Square, but far enough away to not be bothered by the lights or noise, a short walk to 5th Ave and close enough to the subway. Our room was furnished very nicely, the towels and gratis toiletries were fab
 and the library had great video's to lend. Sharon, the clerk on duty most of the time was wonderful! Very helpful with suggestions, so sweet to my 14yo who was celebrating her BD - she even had BD cookies delivered to our room, and just plain nice! We went left for the day and returned at night, we were always greeted with a friendly smile and "Have a great day" or "How was your day? What's planned for tomorrow?" Oh, and the ride back to LaGuardia was a real bonus. Only took 12 min, went thru neighborhoods I've never heard of and only cost $45 (cash, incl tip). The friendly doorman arranged this. All in all, a perfect stay! Thanks!
