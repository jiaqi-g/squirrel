I booked this hotel as it is part of the small leading hotels of the world group and is recommended for children. On arrival the staff were lovely and really nice to my 2 year old son. I had only been in the room a few minutes when reception called to check if everything was OK - a nice touch. Shortly after a staff member arrived at the door with a Batman bubble-bath for my little boy - a really nice touch. The room is crammed with equipment - games console, CD, DVD, plasma TV, minibar but being so small it is a bit tight on space. The bath leaked which was a bit dissapointing and we were overcharged on our drinks order and had to ask for the refund to be returned to our room which they reluctantly did. The location is fantastic, you are 1 minute off Fifth avenue and a short walk to Central park, FAO Schwarz, Rockafeller Centre, Empire states, Times Square, Central station etc. Only one of the door staff were friendly, the others were a bit grumpy. In hindsight, I wish I had booked a cheaper hotel because beign tourists we went out really early and came back really late and so didn't need a nice hotel. Also, the bar was really small and the only communal area was far too small for a child, there isn't really anywhere in the hotel to be with your child other than your small bedroom and the restaurant is too formal to feel comfortable in with a child.
