A friend of myself and I stayed in the Iroquois last weekend. We loved the location of this hotel - if you are in town to see a play you wont be dissapointed. There is even a nice restaurant called Triomphe inside the hotel, best food we ever had. We booked a deluxe room, which was facing the 44th street. Our room had a very nice bathroom,and let me tell you, the beds are like clouds! They offer complimentary coffee in the morning and iced tea during the day which is a very nice treat. 
Late at night we had some issues with getting our arline tickets printed out so we contacted the front desk. We were so amazed by the receptionist Andy, who provided us with the information we needed. But all staff members were very respectful and helpful to us at any time. 
Overall the Iroquois is the place to be if you are looking for a perfect located Hotel, nice staff, a good restaurant and good sized rooms.
We can't wait to stay in the Iroquois again.
