We stayed here April 7-11, 2004. Overall, the hotel was fine. The bedroom was very small and cramped, but the bathroom was huge by NY standards. The floor to ceiling marble was lovely. Everything was very clean, and the beds were very comfortable. Besides the room being small, my only other complaint would be the temperature. It was centrally controlled so we couldn't do anything with the heat. Opening the window didn't really help; we were still very hot. However, the small touches provided by the hotel and its staff were nice (i.e., complimentary bottles of wine and water).
