We just returned from a four night stay at the Iroquois in NYC
We booked an executive king room and we were pleased overall with the hotel
The front desk reception staff were always extremely friendly
It was a little strange to have a bellman help bring up our two small bags (which we repeatedly said we could do ourselves) and then show us the room
For being an executive king room
it was extremely small
It worked out fine for just two of us
but I would never think of staying here with our children
The bathroom was nice and spacious
however there was cheap plastic film covering the bathroom windows
Turndown service was nice with chocolates and a weather card left on our bed each evening
The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable
probably the most comfy bed we had ever slept on
My only other complaint was the iron
It was a cheap iron that gave out practically no heat whatsoever and it took forever to iron our clothes in the morning
The location is excellent
we usually stay on this street (in the Sofitel previously) as we love the proximity to Times Square
5th Ave
Grand Central Station
and the Theater District
We also enjoy the Red Flame Diner which is just a few steps away from the hotel
a great
quick breakfast for a very reasonable price
We will be back
