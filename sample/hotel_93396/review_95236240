My husband surprised me with an overnight for my birthday and from the moment we walked into the hotel I knew it was going to be a great night. The staff are warm, welcoming and helpful - from the front desk to the bellman to the concierge everyone was highly professional. Our room was just fabulous - we stayed in 903 which is a Presidential Suite. I have traveled extensively on business over the years and I have to say this is one of the most comfortable rooms that I have ever stayed in. Not only is the room well appointed and very tasteful, the hotel's location on a street rather than an avenue resulted in a much lower level of street noise than you typically get in a large city. The location is also a great starting point for getting around the city - access to all the major subway lines requires only a walk of a few blocks. We will definitly being staying here again and I would recommend it to anyone without hesitation.
