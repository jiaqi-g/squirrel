Excellent place to stay in Midtown, traditionnal, quiet and comfortable. The staff is very kind and helpfull; a special mention to the concierges, Alan and Vanessa, who provided us with right and precise information.
The only thing which is worth an improvment: the lifts'speed!
PS: ask for a room with twin beds: the room of our kids was bigger than ours with beds of the same size
