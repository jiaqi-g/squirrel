I arrived around 8:30 p
calling ahead to tell the hotel when to expect me and found no doorman and no help with luggage to unload or go up the steps with my bags
A stranger did it for me
Once checked in
an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him
I finally told him to take the luggage
Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat
When I asked about the window heating/AC unit
he proceeded to fiddle with it
I told him to be sure that it was off
He lied and said it was off
It was not off
I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off
There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack
I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark
All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff
I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge
Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge
However
to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light
the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight
The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two
the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot
cold or off is
I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off
There is no ventilation in the bathroom
Therefore
not only was the bathroom completely steamed
which ruined my hair
but also the bedroom windows
As to the so
called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows
And this room really needs more light
In addition
there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted
only tilted that further curtail light entering this room
What a dismal swamp it is
Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast
being first told no and later told yes
And then there was the issue with the eggs
Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs
the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked
Not a good situation
in my opinion
Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable
I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well
When the neighboring room turned on its shower
the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed
I checked out in the AM for a conference
stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening
I am attempting to be fair and point out the good
And finally
when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: "It is What it is
" Now that I am safely at home
I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard
