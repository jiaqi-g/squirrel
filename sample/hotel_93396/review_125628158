My mother and I just completed a three night stay and fell in love with the quaint atmosphere of The Iroquois
the rooms are typically NYC small
but comfortable
cozy and clean
All the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful
The Lantern's Keep
a small bar in the back of the lobby
was a treat
We had lunch at Triomph restaurant in the hotel and the food was wonderful
Location is perfect for theater
dining
Time Square
Rockefeller Center
shopping on 5th avenue
Thanks to all at the Iroquois for making our NYC trip a memorable one
