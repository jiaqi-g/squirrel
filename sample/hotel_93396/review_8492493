My boyfriend booked a trip to new york as my birthday present
very generous eh
He choose this hotel as he wanted something a little special
and he def choose well
Upon arrival we were given a wonderful greeting by the Hotel Reception staff who proved extremely helpful during the whole of our stay
They were happy to help with all our questions and requests relating to our room and also allowed us to exchange travellers cheques daily
which was great
Our room was lovely
a nice big bed which was really really comfy
a fantastic large plasma TV at the bottom of the bed which was a bonus
The Bathroom was wonderful
floor to ceiling in marbel
The bath was great
and the shower over it was super powerfull
which came in handy after long days of sightseeing
The safe in the room was free to use and was operated by your own chosen pin code
and we found this really easy to use and extremely handy
There is a mini bar in the room
we did not want to use this
so requested that it be emptied to take away the temptation which the reception staff arranged with no problem at all
There is free broadband internet access available in the libray
just off the main reception and this was great and proved very helpful
The location couldn't have been better
just a few blocks from the bright lights of Times Square
if you are looking for a hotel with a little bit of class and are willing to pay just a little bit more than average
then this is hotel is perfect
I'd would def recommend
and in fact my boyfriend and I are planning to go back (as we've still so much to see
) and we'll def be stopping there again
oooh
if you find yourself on 8th Ave between 46th & 47th Street
you must call into Scruffy Duffy's for a drink
it's a great irish pub showing loads of live sports
def worth a look
Cheers
