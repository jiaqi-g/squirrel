This gem is located within walking distance to the theater district, shopping, and subway access. The intimate feel of the welcoming hotel
is refreshing. The emphasis is on customer service and the staff could not be more accommodating. The rooms have the most luxurious bed and bedding. The restaurant and bar are fantastic.
