We stayed at the Iroquois a couple of years ago and were very pleased with our stay
We
returned over this Fourth of July weekend
and once again
we had a wonderful 
experience
The rooms are lovely
the staff is friendly
They have a nice little gym and
a terrific little low
key bar in the restaurant
We booked two rooms on their website
at a ridiculously low rate
It was all good
