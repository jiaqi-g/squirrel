My wife and I stayed for six nights in a executive king bed room at 
the Iroquois in July
We chose it after we have read a lot of good reviews about it
The room size is NY standard
whereas the bathroom is pretty big
We really liked the personal approach of its staff
A little draw back for us was that fact that one is not able to switch off the AC
(I solved this problem in my way though
)When reported to the GM
he substiuted us to a free dinner at the superb Restaurant Triomphe downstairs
Great gesture
When my wife got sick
the concierge called a doctor she personally knew well and organized a quick appointment for us
I have never experienced this kind of personal treatment in any of the big hotel chains
We will be back at the Iroquois
