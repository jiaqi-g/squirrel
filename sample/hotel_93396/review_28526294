We stayed at the Iroquois for 5 nights
We had a wonderful stay
hotel is close to 5th Ave
Time Square
& the subway
On our second night
it was raining heavily
in our room
there was an umbrella and we were able to borrow another one to use while we went out to dinner
numerous restaurants surrounding the hotel
The location is really quiet
as I am a light sleeper
there was hardly any outside noise and the bed is extremely comfortable
We were going to stay at Affinia Manhattan
I am glad we decided to stay at the Iroqouis
When I go back to NY again
I would definitely come back
