My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 7 days over Christmas as a treat for my 40th Birthday
Having read the reviews I was slightly disappointed with the hotel and didn't really think it was great value for money or give the personal service it professes to offer
The staff were all fairly helpful and I found the doormen and the porters all very friendly
however the reception staff were polite at best and not as warm as I would have expected at a hotel of this size
Our room was nice and well decorated
but small for the price we paid and the bathroom was extremely small
The bath was not full size and I tried it only once and found it extremely uncomfortable
The bed however was huge (although we had paid an upgrade for this) and probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in
I also liked the iPod dock and the large TV
