I have discovered a ''home''in New York ideally situated ,a small intimate and very friendly hotel that deserves another star ,if only for the people that work there and for the industrious ever present affable Manager,Paul Celnik.
As a creative person I notice everything ,and so I can only say that the attention to the smallest details in this wonderful place is perfection itself. Service is carried out with a real smile ,the staff are very courteous and attentive.
And it's very clean!
Breakfast is a treat with the best offering of fresh fruit and much more. The Triomphe Restaurant ,part of the hotel is a major find,again an intimate setting and the food is fantastic....the Tuna divine!
I hope that not too many people notice my rave review....because I intend to be staying there whenever I go to New York!...and I want to be able to reserve a room.
But do try it out...
Kindest regards to everyone at the Iroquois
