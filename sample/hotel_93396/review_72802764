We stayed there for 6 nights and would definitely stay there again
The beds are heavenly so a good nights sleep was a definite
We were in a room with 2 double beds which are at the back of the building
The location was perfect
not too far from Times Square and all the action and yet we could not hear any traffic noise or any noise at all for that matter
Rooms are definitely small but the beds have beautiful linen and lovely toiletries and as I have said you can be sure of a good nights sleep which is just what you need when NY has so much to do and requires lots of energy
