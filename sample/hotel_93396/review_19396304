We booked this trip last minute and chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews
We made a good choice
it's a great hotel
We had a twin room
Very clean and fairly spacious
with very comfortable beds
Bathroom was also very good
The location of this hotel is also great; close to all the major attractions
but in a fairly quiet street so there's not too much noise at night
We loved this hotel and would definitely return for another stay
