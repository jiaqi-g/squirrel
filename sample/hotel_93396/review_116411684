We stayed for 5 nights on holidays
Price was very reasonable as we booked a few months ahead
Location was so good
Easy walk to Time Square
theatres and Grand Central Station
Our room was not overly large but stylishly furnished
fully airconditioned with a great bathroom
The king size bed was the most comforatable we had on our 25 day trip
Nice bar and restaurant attached
Library downstairs with 2 internet terminals for guest use free of charge
Wifi in rooms
Complimentary newspaper each morning and shoe shine if needed
Housekeepers did a good job each day with the rooms and we could not fault the staff
There is Gregory's Coffee shop across the road if you just want a light breakfast
We would definitely stay here again
