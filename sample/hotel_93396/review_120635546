Stayed here on the advice of a travel agent and the TripAdvisor reviews. Spent 4 nights with a friend sightseeing. The location is 5-10 minute walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and Broadway shows. We found affordable dining nearby for breakfast and dinner. Alan in concierge was great. He helped us get tickets in advance for Mamma Mia and held them for us until we arrived in NYC. He also got us tickets to the 9/11 memorial when the website said there were none available. The hotel also has a car and driver available when you need to get to the airport for a flat rate of $45. A little higher than a cab, but worth it if you don't want to pay for the meter running in traffic! The rooms were very attractive and clean. We will definitely stay here again.
