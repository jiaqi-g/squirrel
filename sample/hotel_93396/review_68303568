I have an issue with cleanliness and germs so I always inspect rooms when I arrive
I also clean the bathrooms myself
For me to feel comfortable in a hotel is a challenge
I can tell you that our room (505) was clean and comfortable
(Even the stairwells were clean
) It was certainly small
but that is what I had expected
The only negatives were the view of a wall and loud rattling pipe noises at times between the floors (our ceiling) when I guess a heating/cooling system kicked on
However
last time I stayed in the heart of Times Square
This time I wanted to be close to everything but off the beaten path
This hotel was perfect
It had an element of class without being pretentious
They include nice little touches like turn down service
chocolates on the pillow
the newspaper in a bag on the door instead of on the floor
an umbrella in the closet
and a card stating the weather for the next day left in your room each night
The staff was very friendly
always greeting you as you would leave and reenter the hotel
They stored our luggage until our room was ready for check in and also stored it from check out until our flight left on the last day
We truly enjoyed our stay here and won't hesitate to stay here again
