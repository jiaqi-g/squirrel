I stayed for 5 nights with my mum at The Iroquois and we both loved this hotel very much
We had a slight problem with our first room in that it was very noisy and my mum couldn't sleep but the front desk staff were very understanding and changed our room straight away after a long restless night
The staff were very friendly and all looked after us very well
The rooms were both great (albeit the first was a little noisy for my mum)
mini bar was well stocked and I loved the small touches of the Molton Brown products in the bathroom
the turn down service where chocs and next days weather was left on your pillow and the free complimentary New york Times
We ate breakfast the first morning at the hotel
wee bit expensive but was lovely so was worth the $55 dollars
I would highly recommend and thank you The Iroquois for looking after us so well
