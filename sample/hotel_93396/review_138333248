This was third year in a row enjoying a short break in Manhattan for this reviewer
so the Iroquois doesn't have the great views or big spacious lobbies of some other midtown hotels
but it was by far the friendliest
most helpful (and quietest) hotel I've stayed at
Nice touches such as free morning coffee and Internet all made it a happy choice for us
Great job
