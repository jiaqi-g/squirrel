Arrived early in New York for a business meeting (10 am), was offered a smaller room which I happily took. Room in size was small but a great room had everything I needed and very comfortable and clean. Staff were very helpful as this was my first trip to New York. Location was perfect for walking around Times Square etc. I found the location to be great and perfect for my business meeting above Grand Central Station. I walked everywhere. Would definitely stay there again.
