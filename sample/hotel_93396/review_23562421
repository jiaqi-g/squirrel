The Iroquois Hotel is perfectly located near Times Square. The staff are extremely attentive and are willing to go the extra mile with any of your needs. The time I spent here with my family was by far the best we have had in all of our trips to the city. It has us already wanting to come back. I will not stay any place else in NYC. Everything is at your fingertips when you stay at this hotel, shopping, great food and nightlife.
