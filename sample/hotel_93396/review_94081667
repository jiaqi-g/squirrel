I love the Iroquois Hotel and I stay there every time I'm in NYC. The location is great, the service is great and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The only negative is the "taxi" service. There seems to be a deal going on between the doorman and the taxis. They try to get you into a sedan and if you don't take the sedan, the yellow cab driver will try to rip you off. It's a racket that I won't participate in. So, stay at the Iroquois definitely! But, go hail your own cab, you will be glad that you did.
