This was the first time I stayed at the Iroquois and it was an extreme pleasure
I've got a selection of hotels that I usually stay at when I'm in NYC and I have to say that I will put the Iroquois at the top of my list
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms were luxurious
Bathrobe and complimentary water and newspaper
This place is definitely the tops
