We stayed at the Iroquois for a romantic 10th anniversary weekend getaway, and we were blown away at the quality of service and attention to details! The staff was extremely courteous and always attentive. The room (suite) was clean and well appointed, with a luxury feel from the moment we entered! Be sure and check out the custom drinks @ their in lobby lounge! (Not to be missed) The room was spotless clean and the bathroom sparkling! Not to be missed, THE IROQUOIS DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!
Also, to make it easy, we had dinner reservations @ Triomphe Restaurant, located just downstairs! They did not dissapoint, the wine selection is top notch and the food is even better. Complex flavors and wonderful "new" ideas combined to make this an extremely memorable dining experience!!
