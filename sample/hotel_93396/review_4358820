One of the Christmas gifts to my family was a weekend in New York
workers
fed up with the snobby Sofitel
had been staying at the Iroquois and gave it rave reviews
I am typically a Marriott points junky
so I have been staying at the Courtyard on 41st for business
but am frankly fed up with the crowds
waits for elevators
no restaurant/bar
and weak service that Marriott provides
For this trip in early January
no convenient Marriotts were available
so I decided to look into the Iroquois
I did my research on the web
They had a very user friendly site
and I reserved a suite or two rooms that adjoined since we were traveling with a 7 year old and a 9 year old
I immediately got an email response confirming our reservation with all the detail required
We walked from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden (since we took the train into the city from Trenton) and got to see a little of Times Square on our way to the hotel
We arrived very early in the morning so I did not expect our rooms to be ready
and they weren't
A very professional and apologetic staff member told us exactly when to come back and introduced us to the concierge and the bellman to store our bags
The concierge was extremely helpful and provided maps and directions
I had done a lot of planning in advance so had already made some reservation
We took the concierge's advice on 5th Avenue
the SONY museum (free) and a carriage ride through central park
We also took her advice the next day on the Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium which were both great
They had fresh coffee in the morning in the lobby
The rooms were very nice
The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean
There is a mini bar (careful
has motion detectors
need to watch small kids)and the hotel leaves a small box of chocolates and small bottle of red wine to welcome you
a nice touch
The rooms were nice sized for NY and the bathrooms looked like they were recently redone and had marble tile
For two nice rooms at less than $500 total for both rooms per night
it was definitely worth it
The best part was that it was a small hotel
so no waiting hours for an elevator
the staff was very friendly
and you could walk anywhere
Broadway
Times Square
5th Avenue
Central Park
yet it was quiet
I would highly recommend this hotel to friends who are looking for a nice boutique hotel
I heard the bar is great (we didn't go we were with kids) and we did not get a chance to try the restaurant either
maybe next time
