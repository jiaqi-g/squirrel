I stayed at the Iroquois a couple of years ago and had a pleasant enough experience so I returned a couple months ago. Much to my delight, they had made major improvements in almost every area. New super high-quality linens, absurdly comfortable beds, high-def LCD screens, etc. etc. Anyone who has ever booked a room in NYC knows there are always two things you are forced to deal with: rooms priced at a premium and they're relatively small. So the Iroquois is not cheap but nothing in NYC is and it's really great to see they have put a lot of that money back into the hotel. And with the new TV's the room seemed twice as big. Those annoyingly huge bureaus that you see in hotel rooms are no longer there with the new TV's. All in all, a great stay with a great location.
