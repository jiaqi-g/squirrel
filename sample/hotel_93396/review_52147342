Surprised my wife with a last minute trip to NYC
It was the first time either of us had been to Manhattan and staying at the Iroquois couldn't have been more perfect
It's a great location
out of the way and quaint
yet just a very short walk from everything
We had a standard king room and found the room size quite decent after reading how small NYC hotel rooms can be
and honestly
if you're hanging out in your room while in NYC your doing it all wrong anyways
just stay home
;)
The hotel including our room was impeccable
the staff was very helpful
and the amenities were great
There is a great little hometown bar across the street and down the block 100 yards for when you just want to grab a nightcap
this is where employees in the area go
cheap drinks & great people
We could have also had the nightcap at the bar in the hotel but wanted to mingle with the locals a little and got to do that which was great
Only improvements I would make: (1) the high speed internet was a little spotty in the evening and (2) when you want ice you have to call the front desk
I assume it's because they don't want to waste the space for an ice machine room on each floor
no big deal really
just kind of odd if you are used to staying in chain hotels
We would (and will) stay at the Iroquois again
Fantastic experience
well worth a 5 star rating
