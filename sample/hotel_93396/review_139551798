the hotel is an OK hotel.. nothing fancy about it all, given the fact that it is a 4 stars establishment, but yet doesn't look like one, however, if you want a clean decent hotel with a perfect location, then this is it, I would say that the negative thing about it was the price, I don't think it was well worth the price.
on the other hand, if you want a taxi take the meter taxi, i was cheated the first day by the door man, who advised me to take a private car to a Russian restaurant that was only 5 minutes away driving from the hotel, and costed me USD 25, the door man added that the place i am going to was too far and the taxi may not know the place, pushing me to agree to the 25 dollars ride, which unfortunately i accepted, when i cam back i decided to take a meter taxi that costed me USD 8 with the tip ONLY.. beware.
the room i stayed in was a superior room, the room size was ok, good for 2 at least, the bathroom size was also fine, no complains, however the room furniture looked old, cheap but clean at least, the the negative thing about the room was lack of lights, I do not think it will hurt the management to put some lights in room (at some points it was irritating).
other than the above, my stay was smooth, problem free, and the staff were very good
