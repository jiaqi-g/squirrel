The location is perfect
Two blocks from Times Square and two blocks from Grand Central
It is within walking distance to many tourist attractions
great restaurants and Subway stations
However
the room was small (I reserved an Excutive King) with not a whole lot of room for storing luggage and other personal items (but more than likely you will not be in the room very much)
Even though the room was small
it was very nice
Good linens and a nice bathroom with nice decor/furnishings
I called to confirm my reservation about two weeks prior to arrival
I informed the rep that the trip would be my first wedding anniversary and my wife's first trip to New York (in hopes that we would have a good room)
Like I said earlier
the room was small
which was okay
but the view was of the central air unit (there was a large pool of water outside of one of the windows which constantly bubbled and made loud noises)
I requested to be moved to another room
but there no other rooms available
That was the only downside of the trip
If you have the option
request not to stay in room 210
The staff was very friendly and approachable
By then end of the week
some of the staff knew our names
I would definately stay again
in a different room
