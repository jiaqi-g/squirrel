We stayed here over Thanksgiving last year
The hotel is very close to Times Square but at the same time it was very quiet
We had absolutely no problem with noise
The hotel itself is very nice and the staff is very friendly
The rooms are on the smaller side
but it's New York
so what do you expect? A nice touch was the hot cider in the lobby every evening
Would definitely stay here again and recommend very highly
