I recently stayed at the Iroquois Hotel. This property shines due to location, style, and service! It is located in the center of the Theatre District and next door to the Algonquin Hotel (a must for 5:00 cocktails in the cushy lounge). Immediately when you walk inside the hotel the city noise is quietened by warmth and an inviting entrance. To the left of the foyer is a very nice library on 44th Street with complimentary computer access. 
My Mom and I checked into the Iroquois on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived early and our room was ready. Before we could get to our room, the staff delivered complimentary wine and chocolates. 
Although a bit small, the rooms are very nice with down comfortors, duvets, marble bathrooms, and plasma flat sceen t.v.'s. 
There was a small problem receiving a fruit and cheese gift from a friend on arrival, but the Hotel Manager insisted on not charging her and called her to apologize. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this property if your stay requires this bustling neighborhood.
