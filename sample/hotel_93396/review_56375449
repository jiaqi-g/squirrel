We returned from the Iroquois hotel last evening and thoroughly enjoyed our stay
First
the location is FANTASTIC
Our room was very clean
the bed comfortable
and the bathroom large and sparkling
We always appreciate having two comfortable chairs in the room because so many times there is only one
It was great for reading the NYTimes
which is delivered to the door each morning
The hallway was also newly carpeted and clean
We were almost next door to the James Dean suite
We found the staff to be helpful
pleasant
and knowledgable
We ate breakfast at the Red Flame coffee shop which is almost next door
The portions are large and the prices low
When we go to Manhattan again
we will not consider staying anywhere else
