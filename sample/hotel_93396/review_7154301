I stayed here with my friend (girls weekend)
We loved it
The beds were very comfortable with great linens
Our room had a flat screen tv with free HBO and plenty of channels
not to mention a DVD player
There was no view from the window (another building) but we weren't in the room much so that was fine
The bathroom was a nice size as was the oddly shaped closet
great use of space
The service was very good and friendly
My favorite thing about this hotel was the feel of comfort
It was a small luxury hotel but didn't have any false pretenses
The people were friendly
not snooty
and I always felt comfortable there
The room and hotel were very clean
turn down service was wonderful
The air conditioning and heat worked great
I don't havea single complaint
very well situated to everything
