Saved us during Storm Sandy
We were able to leave our dark and very cold NYC downtown apartment after 3 days to spend 2 warm and lovely nights at the Iroquois
After searching hotels on 44th street with no vacancies we were so happy when we walked into the Iroquois and they had one room left on the top floor
Great location for restaurants and their own restaurant Triomphe is excellent
Staff are professional and kind
Very helpful and interested in providing rooms to storm victims
I will never forget the experience and we will recommend the Hotel Iroquois to all family and friends when they visit NYC
Location is perfect
Very clean and quiet rooms
Can't say more about the staff
really caring and wonderful
