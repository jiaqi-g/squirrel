we stayed in the iruquois for 8 days on the occasion of our son's wedding. this is a very good hotel in an excellent location, very close to time square but in a relatively quiet street. the room is not small at all, as most new york city hotel rooms are, the facilities are fine and above all - the attitude. every employee, from the front desk to the chambermaid, the bellboy etc. they all did their best to help. every small problem was solved immediately. they were very patient and to sum it up, we enjoyed our stay enormously. the price, considering it is nyc, was reasonable. when we return to new york, we shall return to this hotel for sure.
