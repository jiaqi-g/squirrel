I have been staying at the Iroquois for years (at least 5) and have never had a bad experience. The location is perfect for Times Square and access to Museum Row and Lincoln Center. The staff are great and cooperative at all times. Their gold club allows one to accumulate points. I could not recommend any other hotel in NYC higher!
