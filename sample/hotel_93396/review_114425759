We spent 10 days at the Iroquois in late spring
It is a small hotel by New York standards
Service and facilities are good
solid four
Concierge was particularly helpful
Great location for tourists
only a block from Times Square and an easy walk to theatre district and restaurants
Our only criticism was that after spending 10 days there
with a three
day interval visiting Rhode Island
returning for one night before flying out
the accommodation cost for the single night escalated dramatically
leaving a bad taste in our mouths
Our impression of the Iroquois would have been much more positive if the single night could have been included in the package rate
given that we spent a total of 11 nights there
