What people want out of a hotel is differs with every person
but if you want an affordable
clean
QUIET hotel in NYC with great proximity to Times Square and Penn Station
this is it
I'm often in NYC for work and this was by far the nicest hotel I've stayed in
The room I stayed in was perfect
No view but I was thankful for a corner room that blocked out much of the city noise
I've never stayed somewhere in NYC that was so quiet and was able to get a good night's sleep
I travel to Penn and this hotel was within walking distance
which I like
There are also great restaurants nearby as well as a nice one in the hotel
I got free breakfast because I booked online and the breakfast was delicious
seriously
Staff was extremely helpful and courteous
I will definitely stay here again
Highly recommend
