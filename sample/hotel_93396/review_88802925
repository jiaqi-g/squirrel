My daughter and I chose The Iroquois due to the fact it was close to great shopping and within walking distance to the theatre district
it was more reasonably priced than many others we reviewed
It was just perfect for us
The room was small
yet it was extremely clean with fabulous bed linens and a great bathroom
It was very quiet and the staff was most helpful
Without question
we will stay here again
For a quaint
simply understated hotel in a great location
you should consider The Iroquois
