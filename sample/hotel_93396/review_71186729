I spent 6 days in this boutique hotel and I cannot find anything to complain about.
From the moment that I arrived (John the bell man) to the front desk (Sharon and Caroline) to my requests (Angelic at the concierge) and in my small but very very comfortable room (guadalupe the housekeeper).They made my stay ,"the perfect stay".
I know New York and I always try different hotels. Not anymore. Perfect location, perfect staff. I would recomend it in a heartbeat.
