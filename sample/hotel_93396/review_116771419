Our beautiful night here:
Take the beautiful limestone facade in and walk through the mahogany doors to the elegant but minimalist lobby. Rooms have everything you need but nothing you don't. Beautiful pale colors are very comforting. Nice linens, slippers, and amazing Belgian chocolates for turndown. The library is a must see I am sorry we neither had breakfast or dinner here but I am certain it is excellent. Walk to all theaters and 5th ave shopping. Considering the quality and service, the mid $400 rates are a steal.
