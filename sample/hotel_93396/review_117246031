Location is fine if you want to live uptown
near central station and 5th ave
Lobby is Very boring look like a 2
3 star hotel(Why?) its the same look at their other hotel in midtown Chandler
Staff is helpful
Rooms are nice(maybe little old)
normal size and normal bathroom with Molton Brown schampo etc(very good)
Restaurant didint visit it but it looked ok and it was crowded most of the nights
Free wifi
If you get a good deal at the Iroquis i defenetly recomend it
but for "high cost price"
their is alot of options of other hotels
I probably will choose another hotel next time i visit N
