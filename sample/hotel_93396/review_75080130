We have just returned from 10 days at this hotel, we were in NYC for our honeymoon and the hotel was perfect for us.
The location was amazing... right beween 5th and 6th Ave, a block and a half from Times Square, good location for subways and within walking distance of many of the sights you'll want to see.
We didn't eat in the hotel as it was a bit "posh" for us but the Red Flame Diner which is about 2 minutes away was ideal. Good quality food at a reasonable price considering how close it is to Times Square.
We paid for a "citysights bus tour" from an agent in Times Square ( there are loads of them )which really helped us find our bearings, the $54each is really good value - lasts for 48hrs from purchase and it includes an uptown, a downtown, a brooklyn and a night tour, it also includes free entry to a museum ( can't remember which one ) and a cruise as well. We did all the tours but then used the buses as hop on hop off to see things which were a bit too far to walk.

We would definately recommend The Iroquois and would stay there again if we're ever lucky enough to go back!!
