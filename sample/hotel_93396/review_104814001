I travel to NYC often and have tried a lot of hotels
The key to business travel is getting rest so that you can be ready for the pack jammed meetings and dinners
This hotel certainly delivers that
a big comfy bed
not noisy (one place I went to had club music every night until 2am
walkable to most areas
clean (my housekeeper was awesome
organizing my mess daily and making sure I had products)
really nice bathroom (the shower
I still dream about it
yes a place that actually gives you water pressure)
Now I look forward to my business trips
