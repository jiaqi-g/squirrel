The hotel room was very clean
A little small since I expected a bigger room since I reserved an Executive King
I guess I'm comparing to the room that I had at another hotel on West 51st between 6th/7th Aves that I stayed at 2 weeks before
I don't think the thermostat in my room was working
I had to turn it down so I will not suffocate or have a heat stroke
It's too hot
It's strange to have the alarm clock situated across the bed next to the flat panel TV
Totally weird
When I called the Front Desk to have it moved next to my bed
she offered to give me a wake
up call instead which is unacceptable because I like snoozing my alarm
So I insisted on having someone move it (wires were all tangled behind the cabinet)
My flight arrived at around 8pm on a Sunday night
Checked
in & called for room service to find out that they don't have room service on Sunday evenings
I could pay for a service but I decided to brave the cold
windy night & walk to nearby DB Bistro Moderne to have a decent meal
All these are minor but after a long flight
these things become an irritant & inconveniece
Things settled down the next 2 days
The Front Desk staff needs some improvement
Sometimes it feels like they just want to answer 1 question
The Front Desk staff at the West 51st St hotel knew my name on my 2nd day
Those are nice little touches
I must say that the bed was comfortable & the bathroom amenities were excellent
I'm glad that I paid what is considered an average rate for NY standard when I booked this hotel
For the price that I paid
I can recommend this hotel to friends
But nothing more
Thanks hotel
