Celebrated our 25th anniversary in New York and after reading reviews of all the hotels, chose the Iroquois because of location and we did not want a large chain hotel. The Iroquois exceeded our expectations! From the moment we checked in, we were pleased with the service and although our room was small (which we expected) it was so comfortable with a wonderful bed made up with fine linens. The bathroom was sparkling clean and had the plushest towels! We can't wait to go back to New York and the Iroquois!
