A great position
clean rooms with undated bathrooms
professional friendly staff ready to assist
The Iroquois staff could not be more helpful 'the weekend' NYC shut down (still cannot believe it) when a hurricane was threatening
Staff went out of their way catering for our many needs over this weekend which was way beyond their normal duties
Thank you and well done
