We have just come back from spending six days at the Iroquois hotel in New York. This was our first time in The Iroqouis. We have found it by "mistake" over the net thru an affiliated hotel after looking at the hotel website and reading the details, we have contact the hotel directly and made the reservation. As a frequent traveler with countless trips to NYC. I had never heard of it. As a global business traveler I have learned to judge hotels on the basic competency of the staff. Good service almost always translated into a good experience. My wife and I spent last week at the Iroquois. The hotel was fantastic. Classy, clean and very warm and welcoming. The room was enough for two people not to be falling over each other and their luggage. Our room which although wasn't huge, was very comfy, with a stunning marble bathroom and molten brown toiletries, which were regularly replaced. After a long day in the city, to come back and have our beds made and chocolates left on our pillow as part of turndown service, was great for us. The staff, as other people have said on here, are what really adds to this hotel. Friendly and pleased to help you. Complimentary Coffee at the lobby every morning from 7 AM to 10 AM Is a big pulse( I would start it at 6Am for the Jetlag suffers). And a cold lemonade for rest of the day. The hotel is well situated, close to the show we attended. close to times square, and the subway is a block away. It clearly has an European flavor to it, small but complete. It's a great location.
All in all, we would definitely go back! V. recommended
