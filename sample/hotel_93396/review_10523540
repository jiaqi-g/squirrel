My husband and I were in New York for three nights, and found this hotel to have the most perfect location of any hotel we have stayed in. The subway, theaters, restaurants, shopping... everything is nearby. 
The hotel lobby is small, but efficient. The "New York Library" is a great little room that houses books, a computer and printer (we used for printing our boarding passes), and daily newspapers. The concierge is also right there, and staffed with knowledgable people. 
Always friendly front desk staff made us feel at home, and the doormen were always welcoming and helpful. Iced tea at the front desk, candy in dishes and morning coffee gave it a warm atmosphere. This place is not stuffy. 
The room is a decent size by New York standards, and all of the furniture and amenities are top drawer. Loved the Frette linens and robes. 
We were greeted with a bottle of wine, chocolates, and sparkling water, and on day two we returned home to fresh fruit and a perfectly clean room. This place has it down. 
New York is a noisy city, and this hotel is no exception. We were on the 12th and top floor, but honking cabs and garbage trucks were clearly heard through the closed windows in the early morning. Oh well, that's New York. Go to the country if you want quiet. 
We ate at the hotel restaurant, Triomphe, and found it to be intimate and have excellent food. We loved the small plates, and the service was very good. 
Breakfast at the nearby coffee shop, The Red Flame, was terrific, and unbelievably cheap. 
Another great food tip is the Greek wagon at around 50th +/- and 6th. Let your nose find it for you. This is amazing and fresh Greek food that will feed two people for $5. 
So, we will probably stay at The Iroquois when visiting New York again. They made the stay just about perfect, and who could ask for more?
