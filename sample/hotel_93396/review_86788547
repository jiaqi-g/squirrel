Everything about my recent trip to NYC felt like a highlight
starting when we checked into the Iroquois
The Iroquois was everything I was looking for in accomodations
Having owned and operated an award winning B&B for 10 years
I am extremely picky when it comes to selecting a hotel for myself; cleanliness and safety being at the top of my list
The Iroquois surpassed my expectations
The hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly; the rooms
while on the small side (but guess that's typical for NYC)
felt luxurious with down comforters on the beds and beautifully tiled baths
Some historic properties
while clean
can still feel a little grubby around the edges
but not the Iroquois
The rates were a little steeper than I had planned to spend (but not by much)
but was well worth it
given the clean rooms
feeling of safety
and accommodating staff
Though it may be a year before I return to NYC
I plan to stay here again
