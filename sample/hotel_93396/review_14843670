location is a must
but room is so small
We where located on a room with views to a patio
and the noise of the air conditioners machines was so loud that make us hard to sleep
Ordered a baby sitter and arrived half an hour late
Club sandwich at room service was just ok
and service was not friendly
its location is above discussion
is excellent
Will give them another chancem perhaps that day we had a set of circumstances
