Having read such glowing reviews on here
I was curious to see how good this hotel was
and stayed here for a week during a business trip from the UK
The quick summary is that while there was nothing wrong with the hotel
it was nothing I'd get excited about
On the upside
the location is very good
there is little outside / street noise in the rooms (a blessing in this busy part of Manhattan)
the rooms are clean
the beds comfortable
and the bathrooms good
and the free shoe shine service is a nice touch
However
the service was distinctly indifferent from check
in to check
the lifts slow slow slow
the decor of the rooms a bit old
fashioned and tired
the breakfast (in
room) very disappointing and a rip
off of at $15 which turns into $28 once you throw in tip
room delivery and tax
and details were off (such as the iron in my room which was rusty and which stained a shirt)
All in
I'm sure there are much better hotels at the same price range
I've stayed at the Giraffe and think that's better
and next time will probably try the Sofitel next door
Both are slightly more expensive
but only a little
and I believe significantly better
