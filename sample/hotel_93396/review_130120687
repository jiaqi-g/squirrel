My girlfriend and I travel each year to celebrate our birthdays
This was our second time in NY City and our second time at The Iroquois
The central location
just a few block from Time Square
the staff and service at The Iroquois are a “10”
Special thanks to Manager Kelly for accommodating our special needs during our stay and to our Concierge Sergio for all the great recommendations and assistance
