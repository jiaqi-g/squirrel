My husband and I stayed at The Iroquois from Feb 17th to 23rd
Luckily
we contacted the hotel reservations beforehand and ended up choosing a suite (one of 12 only)
So the room was of a good size
though the bathroom still required some exercise
it is not easy for two people to fit in it at the same time
NYC was not so cold when we were there
and it was good as the small bathroom window did let the cold air in
It was not insulated
The staff made an effort to help us w/ our requests
including complimentary tea on Sunday
when the hotel restaurants are closed
In the last day
we asked for a late check
out for which we paid about USD 140
00 and had to change rooms
Then we were given the opportunity to assess how lucky we had been w/ our suite choice
The room we moved to was next to the gym and it is tiny
I suspect all the rooms in that corner are the same size
No minibar as it would not fit in
the window opens to the emergency stairs outside and our oversized luggage did not make its way between the bed and the chest
It had to be lifted to be placed into the closet
The closed was slightly bigger than the tiny one in the suite
though
and although the bathroom did not have a separate shower and bath tub
it was almost the same size as the suite bathroom
Good location
specially if you intend to go to theaters
