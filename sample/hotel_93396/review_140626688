This hotel is all about the location. For a first time visitor to NYC it is amazingly close to about everything. We barely used public transport during our stay. Walking and a few taxi trips solved about all of the transportation.
The rooms are nicely appointed with a really comfortable bead, and a clean large bathroom. It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.
Staff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.
During our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.
In summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep. But it did not provide me with that feeling of a place that goes above and beyond, though the bell boys certainly do!
