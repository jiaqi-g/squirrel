We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed it thoroughly
It's a beautiful place
well appointed room
good sized for Midtown
great service
very convenient location to subway
trains
and an excellent value
the elevators are a little slow
use the one beyond the registration desk; it's quicker
) Would absolutely return
