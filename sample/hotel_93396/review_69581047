We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's a beautiful place, well appointed room, good sized for Midtown, great service, very convenient location to subway, trains, etc, and an excellent value. (OK, the elevators are a little slow...use the one beyond the registration desk; it's quicker!) Would absolutely return.
