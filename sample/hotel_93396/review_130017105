We stayed at the Iroquois Hotel as a result of the hotel we had intended to stay at being booked out for 2 additional days we needed to stay in NY
The location of the hotel was the second most best thing about the hotel
the best was by far the service
The Concierge
Vanessa
was exceptional as was Theodora in the restaurant and the desk staff were also very good
Nothing was ever too much trouble for them
Unfortunately the hotel suffers from simply being a heritage building and as a result is very gloomy and dark
The bathroom is much smaller than we have ever experienced but that may not be out of the ordinary in New York and only one lift working meant continually having to wait
They have however done their very best under the circumstances to provide good quality linen etc
Our big disappointment was the hotel claimed not to have bed bugs and that is unfortunately not the case as I suffered from multiple bites in bed
Eradication of bed bugs is not easy
almost impossible and pest people just checking each week does nothing to solve the problem and it is rife in New York at even some of the best hotels
