This was our first trip to NY (Australians)
The hotel was in a fantastic location mid town
nice rooms
the restaurant downstairs was fabulous and all the staff were fantastic
The concierges were knowledgeable and extremely helpful
especially Alan
Would definitely recommend upgrading your room to king size bed to enable full recovery from all Manhattan activities
as we did
King size was so luxurious
Room was surprising quiet and spacious (we were on the 12th floor)
We also stayed two weeks
There is also a really nice diner next door (Red Flame Diner)
