this was our first trip to ny (australians). the hotel was in a fantastic location mid town, nice rooms, the restaurant downstairs was fabulous and all the staff were fantastic. the concierges were knowledgeable and extremely helpful, especially alan. would definitely recommend upgrading your room to king size bed to enable full recovery from all manhattan activities - as we did! king size was so luxurious. room was surprising quiet and spacious (we were on the 12th floor). we also stayed two weeks. there is also a really nice diner next door (red flame diner). wendyandcameron@gmail.com
