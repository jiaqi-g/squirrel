We just returned from a weekend in NYC and stayed at the Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street
What a lovely hotel with superb staff
Alot of extras like a complimentary bottle of wine
Perrier water
NY Times delivered daily
fruit tray in the afternoon
what can I say
They even gave us complimentary drinks at their bar which is lovely
Our room was boutique size with a desk
chair and queen size bed
Nice size bath with tub with shower that was delightful and the shower had excellent pressure
We would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a quality stay when visiting the city
It is one block from 5th Ave and all the shopping you would want
We must admit this price is not cheap but you truly get what you pay for here
Worth every penny and we have stayed at a lot of NYC hotels
This is second to the Omni Berkshire
