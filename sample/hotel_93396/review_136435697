With 4 NYC hotels under my belt in the same trip, Iroquois far exceeds my expectations and in my opinion, is the choice hotel for me when I visit NYC again. The bed was so comfortable that I spent a lot of time sleeping and having a good rest during my stay. The bathtub was a great addition and the Molton Brown toiletries tops the cake. Housekeeping services are carried out in the day and in the evenings, the hotel provides a turndown service, complete with a weather card for the next day and delicious chocolates on the pillows. 
Internet is complimentary and the signal was strong enough for me to do some work. There is an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe and the luxurious bath robes are handy too. I would also like to commend the hotel for safekeeping my online shopping parcel which arrvied after I checked out. The hotel made a note and allowed me to pick it up at a later date and their exceptional service continues to impress me. Location of the hotel is close to Times Square and the nearest subway station - Bryant Park, is only 5 minutes away. There are many restaurants, diners, duane reade pharmacy and starbucks nearby so you won't regret choosing this hotel.
