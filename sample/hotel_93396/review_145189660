My mother and I went to NY to see the opera and shows, I selected the Iroquois because of location and good reviews. The location was excellent, the room was very good, and the staff was excellent. We were stranded there with hurricane Sandy and the staff did everything to keep us comfortable and well taken care of. They front desk, concierge, and doormen were real people, providing great service. We will definitely stay again. Service was excellent, room was very clean, and quite comfortable and well appointed.
Thanks for the very nice stay.
