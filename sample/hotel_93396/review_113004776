We had an excellent stay at The Iroquois. We where upgraded to a DeLuxe room. Great staff, very helpful, the room was small but very nice and clean. High quality towels and robes, fresh bathroom. Free Wifi with great connection speed. We where on the 11th floor, very quite at night.
It was not so warm when we visited, so I canÂ´t say anything about the quality of the air-conditioning.
5 minute walk to Times Square, Empire State, 5th avenue around the corner... A lot of small nice restaurants nearby.
Really nice restaurant and bar in the hotel. Breakfast was a bit expensive, but there is a average Diner 30 meters away and a Subway down the street...
Smaller hotel, if you want to stay at a quality hotel, but not on the +500 rooms-hotels, this is an excellent choice.
