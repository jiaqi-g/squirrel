I stayed at The Iroquois New York over 4 days and must say I went away rather impressed. Although the hotel was a little dated, its charm had really to do with the building's long and illustrious history (I read somewhere even James Dean once stayed here).
The room I stayed in was small but comfortable. What should be emphasized though is the level of service, in particular Bill the bellboy and Vanessa at concierge. Their overarching help and enthusiasm made my stay at The Iroquois a lot more memorable.
The Iroquios Hotel is strategically located within a stone's throw from Times Square and Fifth Avenue - a real gem among the litany of hotels in Midtown - and most definitely warrants a return visit.
