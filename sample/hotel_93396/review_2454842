Small room & bathroom
They only had limited internet ready room when I stayed in June
Check
in takes forever
even when it was not busy
Elevactors took forever
and like a coffin
Definately not worth over $200 they charge for what they provide
Location is great but there are other hotels that are more competitively priced and you get what you pay for
I like Sofitel next door
