We stayed at the Iroquois for a week in July. Great location, but small room and a view of a brick wall 5 feet away - don't be fooled by their web site pictures showing a great view. The staff were great at check-in, and they were very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Biggest complaint was the Do Not Disturb sign. Apparently we triggered the electronic sign somehow, but it was never noticeable to us when leaving or entering the room. So for the final 2 1/2 days of our stay the room was never made up. We ignored it the first day and figured that we must have been in the room when they came to make it up. The second day we didn't get back to the room until late, after the shows, and found that all towels were still wet and nothing was cleaned. We called the front desk, where they told us that our Do Not Disturb sign was on. I looked and looked and couldn't figure out where it was. Anyway, they said it was too late to get us any clean towels - couldn't they have taken some from a vacant room? Overall disappointed for the money we spent.
