At about $400 for a Saturday night stay
my expectations were pretty high for the Iroquois
While it didn’t disappoint
it didn’t exceed either
I can’t quibble with the location; it is in the Theater District without the cacophony of Times Square and provides easy walking to great restaurants and to Grand Central Terminal
The room was about as small as a luxurious queen
size bed would allow and yet there was plenty of closet space (?)
The only common area is the “library” which the hotel describes as “cozy” – “cramped” might be another word one would use
