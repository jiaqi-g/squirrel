My mother and I stayed at the Iroquois April 26th through May 2nd. It was very nice, close to all the big attractions. I say this is a true home away from home because when my mother and I got tired and wanted to rest we would say let's go home instead of let's go back to the hotel. The staff were extremely nice and pleasant and helped us find some really great places to eat. I would stay at the Iroquois again if I go back to NYC.
