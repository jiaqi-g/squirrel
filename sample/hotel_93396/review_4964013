My husband, two teenage children and two teenage newphews stayed here for five nights for spring break.
We had a two room suite and adjoining superior room which woorked out perfectly for our group. 
The location was perfect, rooms were tastefully decorated and the staff was friendly and helpful.
The beds were fantastic - we could hardly pull ourselves out of them each morning, not to mention trying to pull four teenagers out of them!
We would definately stay here again.
