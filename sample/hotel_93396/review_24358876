We just returned home from a 4 day getaway to New York
This was our first time in New York and we booked a room at the Iroquois hotel not knowing anything about the location or the hotel
We arrived early and figured we would need to store our luggage until check in time
but we were very happy and surprised when we were told our room was available
Our room was clean
comfortable
especially the bed
and a fabulous location
I have to say that the concierge Marga was wonderfully helpful
I feel that i am a very particular traveler and the Iroquois Hotel satisfied all of my needs
We will definitely return
