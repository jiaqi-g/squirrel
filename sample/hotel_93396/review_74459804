This was our honeymoon destination and we couldn't have enjoyed it more
The rooms are small and compact but clean and tidy
They catered for all our needs
The staff were really friendly and helpful
It is 2 blocks one way from times square and 2 blocks the other way from grand central station
All the main attractions are within walking distance or a short bus ride away
We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone
A great all rounder
