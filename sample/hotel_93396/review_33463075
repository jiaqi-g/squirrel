The service was good
not outstanding
but the doorman was usually available and the staff were all friendly and helpful
The room was small (typical for NY) but well appointed
The bed was comfortable
Frette linens and towels
Molton Brown tolietries
serious water pressure
tiny closet (again
typical for NY)
The location was perfect
close to subways
walking distance to Times Square
Central Park
Broadway
even Lincoln Center if you are up for a stretch of the legs
Turn down service was nice
housekeeping was pretty thorough
and room service was good
No real view
typical for the area but the hotel was wonderfully air conditioned
quiet
and felt luxurious
We would definitely consider staying at the Iroquois again
