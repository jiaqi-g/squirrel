I've stayed here a few times and it's a very low key yet classic hotel. 
Pros:
*small and low key
*great location/convenient
*friendly staff
*beds are comfortable
*room has nice charm
*QUIET at night (stayed on my last visit at the Muse Hotel -which was very hip, trendy, large well decorated room, nice glass on wine at 5pm, BUT, I could not sleep ALL night even with earplugs, due to street noise). So, the Iroquois has a nice peaceful location going for it.
Cons:
*can't control temperature. Not really a huge deal but on my last trip in summer I would have liked to have had my room a wee bit cooler than it was.
*can't join/log your stays in their Frequent stay/member club unless you book directl through their website (and unfortunately my company makes me use their company expedia account).
*rooms are very cozy (if you need a large room)
