The Iroquois was recommended to my husband and I by family who had stayed there
We found the room to be small
but adequate for our needs
how much time do you spend there anyways
you are in New York City
The room did not have a fridge
but you can request one
The staff was friendly and helpful
ice arrived promptly when requested
It was July and the air conditioning worked perfectly
We were out and about from early morning to later in the day and did not use the hotels amenities
but heard from other guests that the restaurant was lovely
The location was just around the corner from Times Square
but noise was not an issue
We enjoyed the five nights we stayed at The Iroquois and we would definitely stay there again on our next trip to New York
