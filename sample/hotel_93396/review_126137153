As first time visitors to New York we wanted a mid
priced hotel with a central location and a traditional feel as opposed to the shiny granite and glass types
The Iroquois was it
Fantastic location
close to the sights and shops while nestled in a relatively quiet street full of hotels
clubs and restaurants
Decor is traditional but in good order
The hotel has just 12 floors
(a cottage by NY standards) and we were on the top floor
The room was fairly small but quite clean & comfortable
Complimentary newspaper and free Wi
Fi was great plus an iPod docking station was available too
No tea or coffee making facilities but free coffee or hot apple punch available in the lobby
NY is known as the city that never sleeps and that sure is true
Even on the 12th floor there was an ever
present drone in the background
Bed was very comfortable though so not complaining
Whatever your taste there is a bar or restaurant nearby to suit you
For breakfast
the Red Flame Diner offers great value in a classic setting
perfect for people watching and just 20yds from the hotel
And so to the best bit
the hotel staff
Everyone at the Iroquois was extremely friendly
helpful and efficient
Special mentions go to Alan the concierge plus Bill and Anwar in the lobby who's attentiveness could not be faulted
Altogether a really nice bunch of people
If we ever get back to New York we would certainly look to stay at the Iroquois again
thanks to all for making our stay such a pleasant one
