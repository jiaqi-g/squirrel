I stayed this past weekend at the Iroquois hotel and was very impressed! The staff was fantastic, expecially Vanessa, the concierge who helped us with restaurant, spa and entertainment suggestions. She really went above and beyond in helping us get in to "The Spice Market" (restaurnat) which was all booked up, but somehow she got us in! It was delicious. The rooms themselves were really nice and the location is perfect..a few blocks from Times Square and all of the shows, but on a quieter street. There was always a taxi waiting for us as soon as we stepped off of the elevator. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to NYC.
