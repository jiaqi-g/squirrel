The Iroquois hotel not only looks great it is a great place to stay. The staff is amazing and really goes above and beyond the call of duty. Every staff member you see says hello. Recently when I was staying at the hotel, one of my favorite shows The Game was premiering after a two year break,but unfortunately the hotel does not carry the channel BET. So I asked Caroline at the front desk if there was any way to view this channel to see the premier. Caroline advised that she would see what she could do and check with the staff to see if any could DVR the show and provide me with a copy. So the show premier Tuesday at 10pm and Wednesday morning when I woke up under my door was a copy of the premier. This staff is great! Thank you Caroline and Alex for all your efforts!
