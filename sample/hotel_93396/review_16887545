The Iroquois is a great hotel
We stayed at the Iroquois for seven nights
It is located in a central area between Bryant Park and Times Square
Rockefeller Center
5th Avenue
Grand Central Station and Broadway plays are all within walking distance
The staff at the Iroquois is friendly and helpful with sights and directions
We did have difficulty with the wireless internet connection
One minute it would work and the next there was nothing
We were moved to another floor (upgraded room w/no extra charge) in order to access the internet and it didn't work there either
The hotel is old but updated and very clean and neat
There was no view from either room which was kind of disappointing but the hotel was wonderful anyway
Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to enjoy NY in a central location
