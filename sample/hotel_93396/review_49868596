Enjoyed 3 nights at the Iroquois
Comfortable rooms
high thread count sheets
plush towels and quality soaps
Pleasant service at the front desk
friendly staff
and a Belgian chocolate each night before bed
The Classic room with 2 doubles is quite spacious
and nicely decorated
No view from our window
but the room was extremely comfortable
Only minor complaint is that fresh face cloths were not left each morning (although fresh hand towels and bath towels were)
and the free coffee in the lobby was burnt tasting by 11:30 a
Gratis hot apple cider in the afternoon is a nice treat in the fall
Currently my favourite place to stay in midtown
