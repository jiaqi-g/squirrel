Iroquois Hotel Staff went out of their way to make my our stay enjoyable. The location of the hotel let us be in the threatre district without all the noise. The staff was so friendly and helped with all aspects of our vacation. Don't be afraid to ask help, from threatre tickets to great spots to visit.
