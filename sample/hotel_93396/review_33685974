If you want to stay in a hotel that offers customer service, a clean, beautiful atmosphere, this would be the place for you. The staff could not have been more attentive and happy. Yes, happy! The location is within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park and great shopping. The complimentary coffee in the lobbey is delicious and the Library is a nice added touch. Warning-The diner next door called The Red Flame is horrible.
