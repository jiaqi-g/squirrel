The Iroquois was great and really helped to make our holiday a memorable occasion for us! Perfect location in the theatre district for midtown and downtown, very friendly and helpful staff (the conceige, Alan, was brilliant and so helpful!), all the basics needed for a room only stay, clean and comfortable!
The only missing thing......a very minor aspect......was coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms....a mini-bar is great, but nothing beats a good cup of coffee or tea when you want it!
