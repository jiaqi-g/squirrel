My daughter and I spent a couple of nights in NYC to see a Broadway show etc
Once again
I decided to stay at the Hotel Iroquois
As always
the accommodations were absolutely wonderful and the staff catered to our every need
The rooms were impeccably clean and the beds were so comfortable
The location is perfect if you only have a couple of days in NYC as the hotel is in close proximity to many of the attractions
Iâ€™m looking forward to spending some more time in NYC and I will surely be staying at the Hotel Iroquois
