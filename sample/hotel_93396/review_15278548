As a seasoned traveler with countless trips to nyc
I was surprised when our travel agent suggested the Iroquois hotel
I had never heard of it
but trusted our long time advisor
he gave us very good advice
As a global business traveler I learned to judge hotels on the basic competency of the staff
Good service almost always translated into a good experience
My wife and I spent last weekend at nthe iroquois
we were there to see a couple of broadway shows
The hotel is well situated
close to the shows we attended
close to times square
and many of new york's attractions
It clearly has a european flavor to it
small but complete
The rooms are on the small side but well appointed
What sets this place aside is the service
the staff was competent and attentive
polite but not overbearing
no false smiles with a hand out for a tip
the concierge
marga
was more than outstanding
Very important everwhere
but particularly in nyc
The hotel restaurant was excellent but small
make a reservation when you book
All in all a great weekend
