Since I had researched and planned a Christmastime visit to New York City for my daughter, granddaughter and myself, for more than a year, I wanted everything to be perfect on many levels. Of all the hotels listed in Trip Advisor the Iroquois was my decision. This small charming boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan gave us a feeling of warmth and comfort...sort of a home away from home. The hotel staff was exceptionally pleasant and helpful in every way. Vanessa, the concierge, guided us on our first time experience of the New York subway without a hitch. She also recommended some great restaurants. This hotel was truly the key component of our trip that helped create a vivid lifetime memory...especially for my ten year granddaughter Emma. In the future, whenever we visit "The City" again, we will definitely stay at the Iroquois.
