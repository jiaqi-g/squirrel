We spent three days and nights at the Iroquois Hotel. Every night, our bed was turned down. If we had a request, it was met immediately. Service cannot be beat. Examples: Our sink stopper was not working properly, and maintenance came immediately to fix it. We did not have washcloths, and housekeeping came instantly to bring as many as we wanted. Really, it was a wonderful stay.
