We stayed at the Iroquios over the Easter Weekend. I had booked the hotel well in advance and got a winter promo rate, approx Â£700 incl of tax for 4 nights.
We arrived on Good Friday and were upgraded to a King room, which was heaven having such a big comfy bed, when I was beyond exhausted. We were given a paper every morning. Coffee was complementary from 7am downstairs. Location for us was fantastic 4 small blocks from Times Square. The great thing is you were so close without the traffic noise!!
Thank you to all of you at the Iroquis we were very impressed and would stay again.
