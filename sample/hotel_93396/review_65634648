This is my second visit to this hotel and once again it exceeded expectations
The location for midtown New York is superb
You can walk anywhere for shopping
museums
Times Square and theater
Yet the hotel is located on a quiet street away from the tourists
Though small it has all the luxury and service you could ask for
The front desk staff and concierge were very helpful and had great suggestions
The rooms are small but well equipped and the beds and linens were wonderful
I would stay there again in a heartbeat
