We stayed at the Iroquois for our honeymoon and were warmly greeted by Bill the doorman who showed us to our room and recommended the Red Flame Diner next door for breakfast. Breakfast was very expensive at the hotel so the diner was a good (and much cheaper) option. Although they are quite small the rooms are very comfortable and the beds nice and cozy...you get chocolates on your pillow each night too which is a nice touch. Free internet access is good too, especially as we were then the volcanic ash disrupted flights and we needed to rebook our flight back home. All the staff there were welcoming and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Although The Iroquois is minutes away from Times Square you wouldn't know it, it was peaceful and quiet.
