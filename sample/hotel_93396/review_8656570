(Weekend rates) is unacceptab, in my book. We were stunned to find out how small and uncomfortable the bed was, and could not get a proper night sleepat all. I complained, but all I got was an offer to switch to a suite, at a price which was over $800 a night... (And yes, I told the girl at the front desk I am going to write about my experience, so others could learn to avoid this hotel,to no avail).
This is a relatively nice hotel, small (105 rooms, I was told...)nicely done & clean, with good service and great location.The drawback is the VERY small size room, I mean V E R Y small, which found me banging my head over the stonecladded side table while turning at night..., and yes, again, traveling with my wife, she asked for an inflatable matress (They had none...) and could not get to sleep properly either. 
We would not consider this place again. There are many other hotels in the same block, for this price. Do not forget to ask specifically for a minimum of Queen size bed, for two adults in a room, since what is the standard in any chiep motel in the US, is "special" in a "Boutique hotel" in Manhatten. 
Though we made reservations well ahead of time, and arrived early in the day, we were not properly accomodated. Take this into considerations while dealling with this hotel.
