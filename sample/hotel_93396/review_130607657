The location is good and central to various New York hot spots (Time Square, Central Park &Radio City). Ideal hotel for walking to all the mentioned locations with no need to a Taxi (burn those calories). We reserved a suite which was ideal for the four of us. The hotel has only one elevator in operation because the other is under refurbishment and during the morning you may have to take the stairs. we were located on the fifth floor and the A/C in the room is not best in class, That is to say, if you like sleeping in a cold room 70 degree or below after a hot not - do not count on it. The A/c in the room may not have the power to do so, Overall good location and the room was nice but nothing to write back home about,
