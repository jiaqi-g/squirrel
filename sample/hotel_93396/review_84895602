We had an excellent experience with this botique hotel in New York
Perfect location
clean rooms and not too small for New York
The staff was very helpful
especially the concierge
He went out of his way to help with reservations
The only negative aspect of our stay was that our room was not ready by 3:00 as promised
but overall this is an excellent hotel and I would stay there again
