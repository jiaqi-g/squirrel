Everything about the Iroquois was first
The staff were attentive and knowledgeable
As we stayed for a week
we got to know the front desk clerks as well as the doormen and housekeeping staff
The room was on the smallish side
but terrifically well
appointed and well
thought
Not sure why you'd need any more room
when you get right down to it
We also tried the Lantern's Keep bar (excellent) and treated one of our Manhattanite friends to dinner at Triomphe
which was exquisite
If you are looking for a stylish
small hotel in a great location
walking distance to Grand Central
library
Broadway theatres
look no further
As a regular NYC visitor
I've enjoyed staying in many different hotels over the years
but I'm sure that I'll be back at the Iroquois in the future
