The Iroquois has an intimate feeling to it; a small staff works hard and multitasks but they seem pretty dedicated and I noticed several familiar faces - including senior managers - since my last visit a couple of years ago, and continuity usually augers well. The small bar and nifty restaurant are a more enjoyable setting for a quiet drink with colleagues or friends than the pricy pretention across the street at the Euro-optimized Royalton or the noisy and touristy Algonquin nearby. Still, when I arrived at the Iroquois, the doorman looked the other way when I said hello, and when I asked if there was a payphone I could use, he had no idea. My room was quite comfortable - clean, well appointed...neither new nor worn - and the electronics were modern and functioned well, but for me - on a business trip - it was one massive hassle to have to suffer through three days during which the wireless Internet didn't work for hours on end. The hotel staff forwarded me to their Internet provider who during an hour on the phone tried to solve the problem, but the outage remained and the result was hours of wasted time - call after call to fix the problem - when I had wanted to work in my room. To their credit, I was not charged for incidentals to compensate for the inconvenience. Still, perhaps this hotel is better suited to New York weekend trip visitors and tourists because I think the business services infrastucture is lacking (e.g. a fax was sent to me marked urgent, but it never arrived in my room). I might return here, but not on a business trip.
