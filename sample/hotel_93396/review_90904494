Stayed in a 'Presidential Suite' with my wife and 15 year old daughter
Amazing suite
has full living room
dining room
even a small kitchen with fridge
microwave
and coffee maker
Nice bedroom with comfy king bed
and a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom
All staff were very courteous and responsive
site world
class restaurant (Triomphe)
a great little diner a few steps down the street
and many stores/restaurants within a block or two
Only a block and half from Times Square
yet fairly quiet location
We easily walked the 5 blocks to up 5th Ave to Rockefeller Center
even in a snowstorm
GREAT place to stay
highly recommend The Iroquois
