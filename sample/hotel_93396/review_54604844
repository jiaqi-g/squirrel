With all the raves on this hotel and knowing how good the location is
I had high expectations that were just not met
The Pros
Location
comfortable bed & linens
clean rooms
reasonably quiet
staff that tries hard & is pleasant if somewhat unpolished
got a great price on travel
ticker
com
excellent value buffet breakfast 
The Cons
very small dark rooms (the first room I was shown faced a brick wall)
poor cell phone reception for At & t
security seems lax
I won't write more here about this
but hotel needs to pay more attention to front door/ lobby coverage 
front desk staff seems unseasoned
The Iroquois feels more like a club than a hotel
I can recommend it if you get a great deal & don't mind small rooms
