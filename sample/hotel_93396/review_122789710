I really liked this hotel
I arrived after checking out of another hotel early as I was unable to get any sleep due to the noise
I know NYC is a noisy place but this was unbelievable
Anyway told the check in staff I wanted a quiet room and was taken up to see 2 rooms
Decided on one and asked if the air conditioning in the room could be turned off
It can't be but they sent up the engineer to shut the vents off for me
They were unbelievably patient and kept saying it really was not any trouble
but I did feel a bit petulant about it all
Absolutely nothing was too much trouble
For staff attitude alone I would stay there again
Rooms are small but have everything you need
Bed was super comfy and the bathroom while small too
was clean and had all amenities
Bonus for me was being able to open the window just a little for some fresh air
Complimentary coffee in the loby is a nice touch
Ihad booked several Broadway shows and it was so convenient to walk a couple of blocks to the theatre
I would definately stay there again
