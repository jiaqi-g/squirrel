The Iroquois is member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World and is shows in the rooms and the service
The people there were very accommodating and informative
Location wise it was a two minutes walk to Fifth Avenue and a 4 minutes to Times Square
what else do you need
The only time I used the subway was when I went to the statue of Liberty tour which was on the southern tip of Manhattan
otherwise all my tours was done on foot
The concierge were very helpful
they got us a good deal to the Lion King Musical
The room was on the small side but was immaculate and super clean as was the marble bath with is Molton Brown amenities
The beds were VERY comfortable
the room had an LG LCD with HD channels
With some built in closets
There is a turn down service where they prepare the bed and put a weather card for the next day with delicious chocolate
a nice touch
A thing Iâ€™m really picky about hotels is quietness
sometime I wonder if I'm in NYC
the rooms were well soundproofed
Really deserve to be an SLH
A fine pick indeed
