We loved our stay at the Iroquois Hotel. So close to Central Station & Times Square as well as great restaurants and parks. I loved the feeling of the smaller hotel - the small room was tastefully decorated, the linens were high quality, the staff were all pleasant and we felt it was great value for our money.
