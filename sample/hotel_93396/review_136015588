Everyone that works there was so friendly and available to assist
The hotel was perfect and we enjoyed our time in the city and having a great hotel experience was part of that
The door was always opened for us and the desk personnel assisted us with everything we needed
The Triomphe restaurant served us wonderful drinks (little pricey) but well worth it as we settled in for the night
The location was excellent (walking distance to Broadway
shopping
Times Square)
The beds were awesome and comfortable and the rooms were clean
