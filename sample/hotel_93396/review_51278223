I have just returned from a week at the Iroquois and I cannot say enough good things about the hotel and the staff. Quality, quality, quality - caring, polite and professional. These are the words that best describe the staff at the hotel. From Catering to Reservations, the Front Desk, the Manager and Chef Zobel at the Triomphe restaurant in the hotel - you guys are the absolute best - my home away from home!! See you all in 2010!!!! A definite 2 thumbs up!! Kathie Taylor
