When I travel to New York City I chose a smaller boutique-style hotel in this general part of the city and in this price range. Overall The Iroquois was a good experience. The staff were very friendly, polite and helpful without being intrusive. The hotel was immaculate, the beds were very comfortable, the rooms are well appointed and tastefully decorated and the location was excellent. The exercise room was more than adequate. We did not have a chance to try the hotel's restaurant Triomphe.
The only drawback is that our room , compared to other similiar hotels I've stayed at in the city, was quite small. Otherwise a very good boutique style hotel.
