We stayed at this hotel on our New England trip this year. We reserved a suite for us (4 adults and 2 kids). And I must say that after staying in many hotels in New York already - this is one of the better places and for sure i will return. It was in the center of town near 5th avenue and all major sights are in walking distance. It was surprisingly quiet and we enjoyed it a lot. The rooms were nice and big and much better than expected, because when you walk into the lobby your first impression is that this could be another trap. But wait and see the rooms first and you will be happy considering that New York is really the worst place to get a decent hotel for an ok price.
All in all i recommend this place
