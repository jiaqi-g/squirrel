Last time in NY I stayed at Algonquin. I thought it was OK but not more than that. This time I chose this hotel which was better but it is not more than three stars. The service is OK, the door men are very nice, the reception so so. The room is very small and you should not live here if claustrophobic, I practically stared into another wall from my window. The location is very good, close to shopping on Fifth Avenue.
