Conscierge services perfect as always (thanks Vanessa & Allen). Check-in/out, very friendly, received an upgrade to a suite (thank you). Very nice rom with separate sitting area, bathroom with a bath and sperate shower. Our girls had a deluxe room lacking a refrigator, so the minibar items were just place on a buffet, otherwise everything was more than OK. So we will definitaly come back soon!
