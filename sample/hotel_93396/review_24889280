If you are looking for a place you can call "home" then you have to go to this hotel. Excellent location, nice rooms and decoration, friendly people and a very confortable and familiar atmospher. The perfect place for business or just relax... I live in Paris and I can say that this hotel is my second home everytime I travel to New York.
