I have stayed at the Iriquios in NYC several times, not only with just my husband, but with my mom for a girls trip. I would not stay anywhere else. I love the inviting & cozy lobby with library attached, the SPOTLESS rooms and bathrooms, comfortable beds, outstanding service and convenient location to Times Square and surrounding areas. We were just there with our 3 children for Spring Break and they even said they wouldn't want to stay anywhere else! Well done Iriquois!
