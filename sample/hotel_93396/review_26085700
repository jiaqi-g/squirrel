I would be delighted to stay in this hotel again
First
the service was impeccable
Everyone from the doorman to the front desk person was friendly and accommodating
I extended my stay for one night and asked to be moved from a room with two double beds to a room with a single bed (due to a change in occupancy) and they did so with no problems and even upgraded me
I got late check out all three days of my stay with no problems
Additionally
when they weren't able to service my room due to an accidentally
left "Do Not Disturb" sign
they left a note and were happy to come up and service the room at 9:30 pm
Secondly
the location is a quick 5 minute walk to shopping and Central Park
in the end
it was the beds that sold me
so comfortable
