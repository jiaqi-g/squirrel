I've just got back from my stay at The Iroquois and felt compelled to give it a review.
I really liked this hotel. I thought the staff were great (unlike the previous reviewer). I get fed up of that fake "have a nice day" stuff that (some of) our North American friends like so much and I thought the staff here had the balance just right... Not too overfriendly and very helpful when required (I would particularly like to mention the barman Casey).
While the rooms were a little on the small size and my room didn't have much of a view, the bed was fantastic and the bathroom clean. There's free WIFI in every room, an iPod dock, big TV, as well as all the usual stuff (iron/ mini bar/ umbrella/ safe). What else do you want from a hotel room?
The location is great for all the usual sightseeing stuff, (I'm not a huge fan of Midtown) and my step mother, who was visiting NYC for the first time, was equally impressed with The Iroquois.
My only negative point was that the bar shut rather early (around 11pm) on the Saturday night and is closed all day Sunday.
My step mother's (and my) holiday was enhanced by my choosing this hotel. That is recommendation enough for me.
