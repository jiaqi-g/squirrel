The Iroquois is conveniently located near the Theater District, but just far enough away from the noise of Times Square. The staff was courteous, friendly, and extremely helpful. The room was very comfortable and very clean; amenities were great - slippers, paper, and delicious treats (chocolate covered strawberries or cookies were waiting for me when I came in at night). The library up front spoke of another era, when hotels were more than just a bed.
