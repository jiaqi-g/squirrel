Wife and I stayed here from 3/13-3/17/09. What a GREAT place!! Everyone was very friendly and felt more like family atmosphere. Rooms were just right in size with ample closet space. Everything was very clean. I booked on quickbook and got a great rate. Being on 44th St between 5th and 6th avenue was awesome. Subway had 2 easily accessible subway stops to take you to all of Manhattan. Regina and her manager really shined. We hope to come back again as soon as possible.
