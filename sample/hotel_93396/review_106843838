Staff beats all
Exceptional in service and friendliness and willingess to chat
I've stayed in many hotels for business
this one also a 2 week stay
and I find the personalized charm much more important than having the modern amenities
I've come away from this hotel with some fond memories of the staff
hi Iva
Nancy
Eddie
Robin
Connie
Casey
and all
Rooms were always clean and serviced well
and I loved the complimentary shoe shine service
Over two weeks
I've had to change rooms 3 times
from a single king size to a suite for 3 people
to a single double thanks various commitments with friends and family
all accomodated by the friendly staff
Nothing was a problem
The best? Of course
the James Dean Suite
What a sense of history
Further
the restaurant connected
Triomphe
is one of the BEST restaurants in midtown
not just according to me
but also Zagats
It is phenomenal
If you stay here
you must try something from the menu (also does the room service)
Criticisms? Two small things: If you're a regular gym goer
I'm afraid this hotel will fall short in equipment
although it has a nice sit in sauna (2 treadmills
an elliptical
a limited number of freeweights
plus a Smith rack and a lat pulldown machine)
the lifts
the lifts
but apparently they will be rennovated after my stay there
As a tourist however
you should definitely choose this place
It's a quick walk over to Times Square
all the shows
Rockafeller Center
5th ave designers and a little bit further to Central Park
At the end of my stay
I was sad to leave
that's how good it was
