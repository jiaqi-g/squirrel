My wife and i opted to stay at this hotel as it is a member of "Small Luxury Hotels of the World". Located between Times Square and 5th Ave, the location could not have been better. From previous reviews I had understood that the rooms were small, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were not as small as I had feared. Our room faced the back, and that was OK, as it is probably more quiet than the front. The staff was good, but I honestly would have expected a little more attentiveness. The only "bad" experience was when we ordered ice for drinks, and the staff who came was visibly displeased with the tip he received. In my opinion it is OK to be displeased, but not OK to show it in front of the customer. I can highly recommend the hotel for other visitors to NYC.
