We live in NYC and still chose to get out of our own apartment to the Iroquois hotel for a weekend. A getaway in our own city!
Greeted by by the lovely, spic-n-span lobby, on an unexpectedly posh block just outside Times Square - I was surprised by the feeling of being in a little auberge with superior service.
The linens, bath products, attention to detail, spotless rooms and anything-but-generic decor made me feel like I was in a high-end London boutique hotel - and yet it is steps from the most exciting tourist spot in the world.
Great. Ask for the lovely suites.
