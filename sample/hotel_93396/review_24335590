We have just returned from a short spell in New York
and I picked the Iroquois Hotel
49 West 44th St
New York City because it's so central and convenient for mid
town Manhattan
This is a real gem of a hotel
it's small
personal and intimate and I could not rate the friendly service more highly
If you want a personal friendly service and the best breakfast in town (try the hot 'French toast' filled with fluffy cream cheese and served with syrup and fresh strawberries
absolutely delectable
then this is the hotel for you
The interior of the lobby is stylish and intimate
and our bedroom with its two deliciously soft and downy double beds and the Molton Brown goodies in the bathroom was comfort itself
A nice personal touch was the little cards left in our room every evening with details of what the weather would be like the next day: very useful if you want to avoid taking the Circle Line harbour tour in driving snow
And the complementary hot
cinnamon
scented 'apple cider' on tap in the lobby when you come in from the cold was a real treat too
we took full advantage of this and enjoyed a chat with the lobby staff over the counter at the same time
They couldn't have been more helpful
they booked our concert at the Carnegie for us
then and there
sorted out our Circle Line and theatre tickets (the '39 Steps' at the Helen Hayes is a joy
explained the subway system to us
and always remembered to ask how we'd got on the night before with all our ventures
I'd give the Iroquois 10/10
We just loved it
