The hotel is a member of the Small Leading Hotels of the World chain...all my previous experiences with this club were great...but NY has been a disappointment. We booked the hotel for a 1week stay at NY for New Years, coming all the way from Moscow. Were disappointed when arrived, because neither the pictures nor its status qualify for LSHW club. The hotel needs some renovations, espcially the lobby, lifts and the windows. Delux rooms are tiny...second smallest after usual Paris hotels. This is a good place for business trips, but i would not go there for a personal trip. Moved to the mandarin oriental after 3 days there.
