Lovely small hotel in a great location in midtown
The rooms were a little on the small side but very clean with all the right amenities
The staff were helpful and welcoming
The only downside is the hotel bar isnâ€™t that nice but the Royalton across the road had a beautiful bar so we often went there instead
