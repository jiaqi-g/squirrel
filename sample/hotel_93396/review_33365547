I stayed here with my 2 children for 4 nights
We booked it for the great price and the location
The hotel is very small
It has a small lobby
sitting area and small restaurant
The staff was very pleasant and helpful
When we checked in they gave us an option of 2 rooms the first one was the one I booked and it was extremely small
The second one was the room we upgraded
It was an additional $100 per night
It was a one bedroom suite and far superior
Since this was originally an old hotel the bathrooms are very small
My major complaint was that they turned off the a/c overnight
Even though there was a thermostat in the room it wasn't working and it was controlled by the front desk
We like to sleep in a cool room so each night I had to call the front desk to remind them to turn on the a/c
They were very nice and had no qualms but we could not adjust it according to our liking
The had Molton Brown bath products
Frette robes and linens and complimentary water
They had turn down service each night and did a nice job cleaning the room
Other then that the hotel was very nice
Great price and nice employees
