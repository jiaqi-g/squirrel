A girlfriend and I stayed for 5 nights at The Iroquois in mid-September 2011. Upon arrival, the bellman gave us a few suggestions for local restaurants to grab a quick bite before starting our exploration. The hotel is located just a few blocks from Times Square, but far enough away to allow us to avoid the chaos when we wanted to. As well, getting around Manhattan was easy, as the hotel is only 4 or 5 blocks from Grand Central, or other subway stops if you want to avoid Grand Central. Our room was on the back of the building, and therefore was much quieter than I had anticipated. Well appointed, very clean rooms (we had two double beds), however there wasn't alot of counter/dresser top space in the room to hold all of the things that two females bring along. We only had one quick/very good meal at the restaurant attached to the hotel (Triomphe), but they were able to accomodate us to make it to our theatre performance on time. All in all, a wonderful experience, and would certainly stay here again.
