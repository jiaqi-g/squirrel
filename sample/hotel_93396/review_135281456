My wife and I recently spent a week in New York for our honeymoon and after much research I chose the Iroquois Hotel
What a wise decision it was
As mentioned in all other reviews the hotel is located 5 minutes from Times Square and Fifth Avenue making it ideal for any tourist
Upon arriving we were given the keys to our 11th floor room by Vanessa who was very friendly and always eager to help
The room was just brilliant
Whilst not the largest hotel room
it was perfectly sized for our needs and we found the view to be perfect and just what we wanted
As it was our honeymoon
the Hotel staff had provided chocolate covered strawberries
chocolates
a bottle of wine and a nice congratulations letter
We thought this was a really nice gesture and started our trip off on a very positive note
Back to the room
The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was well laid out with a large amount of towels
The room doesn't come with a regular fridge as standard
it has a minibar style cooler which will charge you if you tamper with any of the contents however I believe a regular fridge can be provided if necessary
The rooms AC was a Godsend given how warm NY is this time of year
Walking back into the room after a scorching hot day was always a relief
Even if we had the do not disturb on the door
we would recieve a complimentary call in the evening asking if we would like our room cleaned later on anyway which is rare nowadays and a welcome choice
The hotel staff
from front desk to the cleaners were all very polite and always eager to please
I would especially like to thank the three doormen we had most contact with; John
Carlos and Rocky
They opened doors
helped with our luggage and would hail cabs whenever we left on a day trip
The only negative I could mention was the hotel only having one elevator
It's a minor complaint but staying on the 11th floor often meant we were waiting a little while on an elevator that wasn't packed full
As I said
a minor fault for a beautiful
comfortable and highly recommended hotel which we will DEFINITELY be staying at next time we travel to the Big Apple
Book with confidence and enjoy your stay
