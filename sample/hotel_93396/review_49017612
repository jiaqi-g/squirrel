I found this boutique hotel on Expedia
It was beautifully decorated and elegant
The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful
The lobby and library were cozy
The room was romantic and the bed comfortable
Not a great view out the window
but location central to lots of sightseeing and shows as well as the subway
Quiet
