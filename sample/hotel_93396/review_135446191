My trip was a combination of business and pleasure
so I was looking for a hotel that was convenient for both
A friend of a friend recommended it and I'm glad I listened
It started a little rocky because we wanted two beds but only got one
but other than that it was perfect
Great service
clean
comfortable
and convenient to everything (or a train that would take me to everything)
I don't get to NYC very often
but this is now my go
to place
