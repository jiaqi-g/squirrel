We had a great stay at the Iroquois Christmas week
Let's get the negatives over with first
the rooms and bathrooms are small by US standards but by New York City standards the room size was fine
There is no view but unless your 30 stories up
you'll have to put up with lots of NY street noise
Give me a quiet no view room any time
Now the good stuff
Reservations were simple
convenient
accurate
and pleasant
The staff was efficient if not absolutely perfect (one of our rooms was passed over for housekeeping but quickly fixed when we notified the desk)
The sheets
towels
robes better than any other first class hotel I've stayed in
HD plasma with DVD player
Excellent ac/heating; comfortable
quiet
Rooms were well kept; no carpet stains
water leaks
Free Perrier each day
Excellent location for theatre
shopping
Two very big thumbs up on this one
