We stayed at the Iroquois late July 2009
The hotel rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable
Most front
desk staff were very friendly and helpful
However
the room temperature was very warm
Over 4 phone calls had to be placed for help with the air conditioning
You can not change the temp
in your room to suit your needs
Another issue that popped up was that the pre
ordered surprise (cheese and fruit tray) did not come out anything like the picture or description listed by the hotel
That was disappointing as it was a surprise for one of the guests we traveled wih
The hotel told us they were out of cheese and crackers
Disappointing when you are paying over $24 for this service
I would probably try a different hotel before coming back to this one
