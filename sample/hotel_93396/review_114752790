My girl friend and I stayed at The Iroquois from June 9th to June 12th for a long weekend getaway. The quality and location (about 1/3 of a mile from Times Square and Radio City Music Hall) of this small luxury hotel is impressive. This great thing is: it comes at a fair price!
In my opinion, what separate a nice hotel from a great hotel are the small touches. The Iroquois understands that and seem to always go the extra mile to make your stay a great one. The staffs are always smiling, classy and willing to help.
The room (we booked "Deluxe room" which has a queen bed) was big enough (for NYC) , impeccably clean and very well decorated in a classic/chic design. The white marble bathroom was a winner for my girlfriend. The bed and sheets were very comfortable.
I would have given a perfect score, but there were two minor annoyances. Room door was not tight in his sockets, so each time another door on the floor would open, it would make our rattle like someone was trying to enter (scared the hell out of my girl friend twice during first night). I fixed this issue by jamming folded paper between door and frame. Also, temperature control was not responsive (or not working). It was a little cold, but nothing too bad about it.
Next time we go back to NYC, we will definitely return to this hotel.
