I am often in NYC and I have stayed at numerous hotels around the city and this is one of my favourites
I find the staff to be friendly and helpful
the location is really great for both shopping
meeting friends and sightseeing
I always recommend this hotel
It is a bit pricey
but I feel like you get what you are paying for
which is not always the case in NYC
