We spent a week at the Iroquois over Christmas and New Years and thoroughly enjoyed it
Rooms are comfortable (and larger than similarly priced ones at the Royalton or Millenium Broadway in the same area)
being a small
older building
it has elegant touches such as marble baths
high ceilings
We were also pleased with the comfort level
plenty of hot water anytime
thick towels
bathrobes in the room
There is also a fitness room with finnish sauna on the third floor
which we LOVED
Staff were friendly and helpful without fawning
Location can't be beat
we walked everywhere except one day spent at uptown museums
but the subway is 2 blocks away
and several bus lines run up and down 6th and 7th aves
We would definitely return to the Iroquois
