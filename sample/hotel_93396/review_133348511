We stayed at the Iroquois for a theater weekend in NYC and enjoyed it very much. It is the only hotel I know in NYC where every single member of the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is a small hotel -- and the rooms are small, too. But they are very well appointed, clean, and exceptionally comfortable. We stayed in a room with two queen beds (we were two friends traveling together), so that may have made the room appear smaller. The marble bathrooms are clean, bright and contain everything you need. There is a small reading room off the lobby which was a pleasant spot to read the newspaper and have coffee. The restaurant in the hotel is also quite good, but there are legions of good restaurants in the same area. I'd return to The Iroquois given its service, comfort, location in the theater district, and value.
