My 22 year old daughter and I went to Manhattan for her college graduation gift
After much searching for just the right place to stay that would not break our budget
we chose the Iroquois
This beautiful hotel
located conveniently between 5th and 6th avenues on 44th street
fit our requirements perfectly
The hotel is very clean
The front desk staff was professional and helpful
I never heard a peep in the hallways from other guests or housekeeping
We enjoyed being on a quiet street
but just blocks from Times Square and Broadway theaters
We did not hear the sirens and traffic noises that you might expect in New York City
Our room was a "classic" with two double beds
which fit our needs and budget
It was small
but fine for the two of us
The bathroom was very clean with a full tub and shower
nice marble floors
and fine linens
I would only make two recommendations
A small refrigerator
maybe even tucked into the closet
a larger room safe
capaple of storing a laptop computer would have been helpful
We did end up leaving our laptop with the front desk
which is not the ideal place
but we did feel it was secure with them
I recommend the Iroquois for vacation
business
long weekend get
and I look forward to staying there in the future
