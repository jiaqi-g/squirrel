My wife and I stayed here when we went to NYC for our Anniversary
We booked a king executive room
All of these types of rooms are in the back of the bulding
which doesn't do much for a view
but it does stay a little quieter since you're not right on the street
They do have two room family suites in the front of the bulding
which I understand if you get the right room
you can see the Chrystler Building
The hotel is in an AMAZING location
NYC is a very walkable city
but where this hotel is located took it beyond that
We were only a couple of blocks away from all the major sights
Times Square was extremely close
5th avenue was at the end of the street
numerous parks right down the street too
Not to mention a great selection and choice of fine quality
average Joe
and street food establishments
The hotel is also very closely located to all the major subway lines going up and down the island
as well as across the river to Queens
If subways aren't for you
central park and several of the museums are well within walking distance
it will take you a little while to get there (traffic
people
distance)
but we made it from this hotel to central park in about 30
40 minutes
This should also help for the ladies
the hotel was close enough to the theater district
my wife and I went to see The Lion King
fully dressed (we had a "fancy" dinner before the show) in suit
dresses
and my wife in her high heels
She made the walk with much ease
The staff was very friendly and helpful
Since this is a smaller boutique hotel they get to know their guests
The rooms are nicely furnished and provide an ample resting area for your many adventures you are sure to have in NYC
My wife and I had a HUGE delay on our way to NYC due to weather
but the staff was ready and willing to help us get situated once we arrived
We didn't get in until almost 10pm and I figured it would be a ghost town
we'd have to beg to get the room we requested
Much to my surprise
they had our room we asked for
a staffed front desk
and a bellhop to help with our luggage
It might as well have been the middle of the day with the service we received
We were very hungry after our long day of travel and we were able to order some room service right when we got to our room
and it was delivered VERY quickly
I have to say
though
that $80 for some crabcakes and a burger was a little much for my taste
but we were STARVING
The next morning we decided to visit the little cafe in the hotel lobby for breakfast
Again
the food was good
but the price was way too much
This would be the last meal we had in our hotel
because of the price
but also because there were so many great places around the hotel to get less expenssive food
I recommend this diner right on the corner by the hotel
I beleive it was called the red flame diner or something like that
It's really good whatever it is called
We had breakfast there every day and you could tell it was alocal place that real New Yorkers went to
The prices were outstanding and you got A LOT of food
Overall
I think that this hotel provided an excellent place for my wife and I to enjoy our honeymoon and it was the cherry on top of our time in NYC
