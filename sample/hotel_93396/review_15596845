Spent three nights in an executive king room on the "off-street" side of the hotel. Wonderfuly quiet (for NYC), and quite luxurious. Perfect location from which to access all of the best of the city. Walked three blocks to the theater and Times Square, and easily cabbed everywhere else. The staff here makes a huge difference... all are friendly, welcoming, and well-informed. Room service menu was great, and service was fast and efficient. Trays could be better filled-out, but a minor complaint. This place is not cheap, but well-priced for exceptional service, rooms and staff. I won't stay anywhere else in NYC from now on!
