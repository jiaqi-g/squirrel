My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for one night
Valentine's Day; I was in NY for business
Small but charming lobby
and very pleasant front desk help
We were upgraded to the James Dean Suite and it was lovely
Two rooms
not huge but comfortable
Flat screen TV with HD
Very comfortable bed
My only complaint is that the pedestal sink needs to be replaced with a vanity that provides space for women's toiletries
There was no place to put my makeup out
I mentioned this to the front desk clerk who said that other guests have said the same thing
Location is mid
near theater
and for me
near my appointments
folks working in financial services
Easy to walk to many places
