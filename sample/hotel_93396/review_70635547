Good location. Clean rooms. The room size is ridicously small and in fact has more furniture in them than there is room for hotel guests! Service is average for this level of hotel. 
If we visit NY again, we are probably inclined to stay elsewhere.
Not a disaster, but think there are better hotels for the price.
