I actually stayed at this hotel in June 2007 (i know i know I’m very late to write this review but i just had to write a few lines as it was an unforgettable trip). Every time i think of New York i automatically think of my 1 weeks stay at this fantastic hotel. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it and i will stay where time and time again (Financial budget permitting).
Everyone from the porters, reception staff, concierge and cleaners where polite and helpful.
The complimentary Molten Brown toiletries were very unexpected but much appreciated.
The location is spot on for this hotel – shopping, theatre, restaurants, Subway.
If you are planning a visit to New York then look no further – if you stay here you will NOT regret it.
