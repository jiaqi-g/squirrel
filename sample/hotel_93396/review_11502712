We booked the hotel to allow us to stay "in the action" in New York and it did not disappoint. The location is superb - 2 blocks from Time Square and at one end of all the big 5th Avenue shops. Being central in Manhatten, Central Park, Broadway, Empire State Building and 5th Ave are all easily walkable. 
Staff are lovely - really friendly and helpful - concierge sorted helicopter flights for us with less than 3 hrs notice.
The room was very luxurious (Deluxe room) - bed very comfortable, but the room was dark and the hotel fans running the heating were on the same side as our room and ran all day and night - so there was a constant humm from them. This stopped me giving it 5/5
