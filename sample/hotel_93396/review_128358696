Recently stayed at the Iroquiois for business travel
a total of 3 travelers staying in 3 different rooms for two nights
First impressions
very positive in that the staff was attentive when I arrived by taxi
While my room wasn't ready (I arrived at around 11:30 am)
they were willing to take my cell number and call me as soon as it was
Bellman
Concierge
and Check In Agent all were very professional
Room was on the 12th floor
While the room was a smaller room
it was well appointed
Certainly appreciated the comfortable bedding and extra touches
such as the robes and nightly turndown service with chocolates
Based on Trip Advisor feedback
I signed up for their guest reward program
Enjoyed the box of chocolates and small bottle of wine
The room was very clean
I did not observe any areas that needed attention from the staff
Speaking of staff
they were all exceptional
The bellman even greeted me by name the second day
One of the greatest things about this hotel is the location
I was able to walk to almost every sight I wanted to see while in town
Definitely plan on being back to New York and will stay here again
