Our stay at the Iroquois was fabulous
The hotel is located right in Midtown Manhattan and a short walk to many many tourist locations
This boutique hotel is cozy
modern and well maintained
The staff was very friendly and helpful
Some might complain that rooms are small
but remember this is New York City and it's all about location and service
The Iroquois delivers
We were very pleased with our room which faced the front of the hotel and the bed is very very very comfortable
The nightly turn down service and goodies
daily newspaper
internet access
and helpful Concierge were just some of the little things that added to our experience and the hotel's charm
The breakfast was deliciously awesome
We also had lunch at the Triomphe (hotel dining room)
The menu choices were unique
the presentation appealing and the portions just right
Definately worth a splurge
Nevertheless
there are still many dining choices in close proximity for the budget
minded
We drove to NYC
so we found the parking garage across the street very convenient and affordable
I would stay at this hotel again and again
