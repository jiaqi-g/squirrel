My young daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois for a trip to NYC and we were extremely pleased. The rooms were clean, the staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and the location was perfect. We were only a couple of blocks from Times Square yet the hotel was quiet and peaceful. They even left some goodies in our room for my daughter. We would definitely stay here again.
