There are many great things to say about The Iroquois -- great location (only a very short walk to Broadway and all the buzz that brings with it); quiet and spacious (by New York standards) rooms; effective air-conditioning (during a hot New York summer visit); pleasant and helpful staff; and room rates that don't break the bank. We will definitely stay here again.
