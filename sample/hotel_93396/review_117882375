This boutique hotel is a great choice for a holiday in New York. It's central location makes it easy to walk to so many landmarks and places of interest, including shopping! (Fifth Avenue is at the end of the street.) The subway is close by, and this is a reliable way to travel if you don't want to walk or you are travelling a bit further, say to Battery Park or even Brooklyn or Harlem.
The hotel itself is very comfortable and clean, a welcome base at the end of a long day sightseeing. It's surprisingly quiet considering that Times Square is only a couple of blocks away. Don't forget to speak to Vanessa, the head concierge, who is endlessly helpful and friendly. And look out for the charming doorman, a young guy with a bald head, who always has a big smile and a greeting.
