This is not one of the cheaper hotels in Manhattan
but it was worth every cent
We did do an advance booking and payment and hence saved 25%
Normally
I like to stay higher up in the 50's but I went with my GF who had never been to Manhattan and this was a great place to launch our adventures from
A couple minutes from Times Square and the subway
15 or so from Central Park
Stayed for 3 nights
Front desk and management staff were all great
They even checked (in person) to be sure we had an umbrella on a potentially rainy day
Complimentary NYTimes and shoe shine are a nice touch
We had a Superior room
which was not expansive
but certainly comfortable for two
linens and pillows all very nice
Large bathroom
but little space to put your toiletries
We were on the 10th floor and it was very quiet
We did not have an opportunity to use the fitness center so can not comment on it
Lobby is very nice and inviting
We had cocktails in the small lounge which was nice
We had lunch at The Triomphe one day
A couple burgers and glasses of wine cost almost $60
so it is not for the budget minded
Our only complaint was the doorman who we asked to get us a cab upon our departure
He seemed more interested in chatting it up with his friend than tending to us
And it was only one of the doorman who was that way
The other (John) was beyond nice and helpful
All in all an incredible stay
Would highly recommend
