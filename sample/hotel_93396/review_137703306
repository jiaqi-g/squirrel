Loved the Iroquois from it's very NYC decor to it's location and it's wonderful staff
A seven minute walk to Times Square on one side and 5th Avenue on the other
Iroquois could not be better located
I also loved that it's reasonably priced but maintains a luxury hotel vibe with sparkling clean sheets
bathrooms that are contemporarily designed and a funky but historic elevator
My only grouse was that the room was a little cramped for the two twin beds that my friend and I had picked but I guess that's NYC for you
Breakfast was a little expensive so we ended up eating at the Diner next door
Finally the highlight of my trip was the concierge
Vanessa and Alan who both took a lot of trouble to find out our likes and dislikes and recommend custom made "local" itineraries
all in all a hidden gem that I'm recommending to my friends in the US
