Our family visited New York in January for a long weekend break in New York. We were looking for a hotel that was centrally located and the Iroquois didn't disappoint. Five minutes from Times Square, the Iroquois couldn't be more central. The rooms were beautifully furnished and decorated and the rest of the hotel was just lovely. 
The staff couldn't be more helpful and friendly and had plenty of local knowledge and tips on what to see and how to get there. We didn't eat at the restaurant but the fact that every night it was buzzing suggests it's popular.
We can't praise this hotel enough and would suggest that if you were looking for a quality, centrally located hotel in Manhattan then look no further than the Iroquois.
