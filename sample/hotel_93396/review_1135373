Hotel is ok. Just not really my style. I am sure I got the smallest room in the house, must be a specialty of quikbook. Staff was very nice though.I happened to walk into the Mansfield Hotel across the street on this visit and found my next hotel! It had an aura that Iroquois was missing.Fitness room was adequate.
