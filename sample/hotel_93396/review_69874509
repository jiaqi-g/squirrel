This was our first trip to New York to celebrate my 50th birthday
The location was Brilliant for all mid town attractions
The rooms were small but adequate
When we arrived it was in the middle of a heatwave with very high humidity and so all the aircon units were at full blast
The room we were in was right next to the adjacent buildings aircon unit and so it was quite noisy
I approached the Front Office Manager ( Antonio ) to ask if we could be moved to another room
He couldn't have been more helpful and arranged for my wife and I to be moved to a different room ( at no additional charge ) and also wished me a happy 50th ( Great Service )
Nick the Concierge was brilliant as well arranging trips
meals and theatre tickets for us and his knowledge of the city was second to none ( Thanks Nick hope to see you soon )
This is the first time I have ever written a review but I thought it was my duty to let everyone know what a little jem this Hotel is and I couldn't recommend it highly enough
BIG THANKS TO ALL STAFF
