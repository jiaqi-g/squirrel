Stayed at the Iroquois September 3rd
We were smart and joined the Gold Club and I think they gave us a deluxe room upgrade
The room is large compared to other New York hotels and modern even though it is a historic hotel
The bathroom shower was so great
perfect water pressure
The linens were comfy
bed a little firm for my taste
but my friend liked it
The staff was wonderful
The concierge that was there helped us tremendously
I would totally stay here again
