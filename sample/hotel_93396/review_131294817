We stayed 3 nights in early June 2012 and everything about the hotel and staff was excellent
The room was quiet
exceptionally clean
bed was very comfortable and room was large enough for NYC with a great bathroom and shower area
The bath amenities were top of the line
We were on the seventh floor with a room that faced the back so no view
but no street noise
so it made for great sleeping
The maintaince of the property is excellent
No visible wear and tear on carpeting
furniture etc
throughout the property
The entire staff
from front desk to bell staff (Rocky)
to the maid service
to the concierge (Vanessa
who personally arranged a shipment of goods back to our home) were polite
friendly
professional and cared that or experinece was top rate
We had lunch at the restaraunt on the property and it was excellent as was the service
Finally
the location is terrific
Easy walks to major attractions
shopping and to subways
Cabs plentiful and easy to get
