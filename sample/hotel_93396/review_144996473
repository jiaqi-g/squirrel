We have travelled a lot in our lives and we have lived many adventures as well as major difficulties.When we left for NY this time we could not imagine how the hurricane Sandy would impact on our stay in Manhattan.Now ,we are home again and I wonder who has left a hotel after a 7 nights stay (originally 4 nights)and knows most of the staff by name because of their great service and concerns for their clients.The concierges Vanessa and Allan did every day their utmost in order to help us with our cancellations and rebookings to enable us to continue our trip.The receptionists Patrick and Kelly and Mylene and Irena were so concerned about their guests but ensured that we could keep our room ( leaving Manhattan was not possible).Every morning ( most restaurants in town were closed)there was a complimentary breakfast for all the hotel guests organised by Jason and Leonora .And when we finally checked out we were positively surprised to see that Management had invoiced the additional nights in the most decent way.THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE IN NYC.Thank you all.Walter and Anna
