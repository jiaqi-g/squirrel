Our family
two adults and two teens spent one week at this hotel and we really recommend it
The James Dean suite was nice and there were enough space for 4 person
Room was very clean and the bed was excellent
air condition worked well
The staff was very friendly and location of the hotel is the best
If we ever come back to NYC we will use this hotel again
