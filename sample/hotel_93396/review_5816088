My husband and I stayed here between 2nd
9th September with another couple
I had researched places to stay for a long time and from the comments on here decided to go for this one as it got rave reviews
This boutique hotel has an excellent location and has been beautifully rennovated
with a nice reception
library
and restaurant
Our room had a really comfortable bed
plasma screen
sumptuous furnishing/bedding
molton brown toiletries each morning etc etc
but it was an odd shape and a touch cramped
It was not as spacious as our companions room
Also
neither rooms had 'views'
The staff were really helpful and friendly
Coffee/tea is served each morning in the lobby
nice touch
but essential really as there are no coffee/tea facilities in the rooms
The restaurant
the triompe is very very nice
beautiful food
loved it
small and intimate
The only other thing id have liked is a bar area or somewhere to sit in the hotel when you arent in the room
A place to meet people
relax etc
the iroquois does not have this
However it was a fanastic week and would recommend it to anyone
