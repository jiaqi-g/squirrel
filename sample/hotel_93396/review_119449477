Due to never ending delays during the day, we arrived in NY hours after we were supposed to, just after midnight. We didn't arrive at the Iroquois until 1:30am, and i was very suprised to be greeted by a doorman and such early morning hours. He helped us retrieve our bags from the cab, and insisted on taking them inside for us and up to our room. We then met Alex at the front desk, and his level of courtesy and professionalism was unlike anything I had ever experienced in a Hotel before. He not only checked us in quickly, but made us comfortable in knowing that if we needed anything he would do everything to get it for us. We went to our room, incredibly tired and got to fall on one of the most comfortable king size beds I have slept in for years. The bathroom was spacious, clean, and it was obvious the staff there pays very close attention to detail. Overall, one of the best hotel stays imaginable. Would definitely go back and would highly recommend.
