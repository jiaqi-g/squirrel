Despite the rather nondescript frontage, the Iroquois is one of the best hotels we have stayed at in N.Y..
Our room was excellent, (although the bathrooms are a little on the small side), the staff are wonderfully friendly and helpful k but the best thing is the location- a few minutes walk from Times Square.
Overall, a great experience and will definitely stay there again. High praise to all of the wonderful staff who made us feel so very welcome!
