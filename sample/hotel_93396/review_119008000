My Mom and I recently stayed at The Iroquois Hotel for 6 nights. This was our first trip to NYC. Staff were very helpful, pleasant, and professional. We enjoyed our stay here more than our cruise. Both concierge's that we dealt with were very knowledgeable and gave great assistance. The location of this hotel is great too. Close to everything. We will definitely stay here again when we visit NYC again.
