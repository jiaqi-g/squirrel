I had the pleasure of staying at the Iroquois Hotel while attending a Bar Mitzvah at the Harvard Club which is close by
It was recommended to me by a friend who is a savvy traveler and I must say he was correct
The charming boutique hotel is in a fabulous location
short walk from Times Square and the theater district and yet while you are there
the hotel is so charming you feel like you are comfortably at home with all the conveniences
The staff is extremely welcoming
the restaurant on site is fabulous
the bar and cocktail lounge really both charming and hopping
I couldnâ€™t have been more pleased
This is an extremely clean and welcoming hotel and I will definitely be returning when I return to NYC
