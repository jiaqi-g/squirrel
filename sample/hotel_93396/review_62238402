I love this hotel. Recently visited NY with my wife and 2 children (ages 8,5) and can't say enough about the Iroquois. The staff couldn't be more friendly and they went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. While the hotel was very kid friendly I wouldn't hesitate to stay here on business or for a weekend getaway without the kids. You can't beat the location- a short walk from Grand Central and Times Square (less than 5 mins.) but without being right in the middle of it. Also walking distance to Central Park, Empire State Building and Rock. Center. 
The room was very clean and modern with extremely comfortable beds! This hotel offers a combination of comfort with a touch of class that is hard to find...
Cant wait to go back!
