My mum and I were staying at the hotel for two nights in October. I was told ahead of time, that hotel rooms in NY are generally small so I did not expect too much at arrival. The rooms are small but very nicely furnished. The linen is so comfy, the towels and bathrobe extremely fluffy and all in all the room very clean and comfortable. Most people are in the room to sleep only anyway, so no need for a huge room. The shower gel etc. are from MoltonBrown so very good quality and they smell great. The little bar serves nice cocktails in the evening and they also have a business center where you can use the internet free of charge. The staff was very friendly and accomodating and always quick to offer help, if you looked like you need something. The Concierge was a great help as well. I had tried to get tickets for the new World Trade Center memorial prior to our trip but it was fully booked. The lady at the concierge desk got me tickets. She also explained very well everything else we needed to know. 
The hotel itself is in an excellent location, walking distance to Time Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, Fifth Ave, ...
Would certainly recommend this place to anybody interested going to NY.
