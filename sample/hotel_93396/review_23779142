I stayed at the Hotel in December because a good friend of mine recommended it let me tell you after that stay I'm going to have to rethink my friendship
The hotel looks fairly nice and so do the rooms until you have to spend a few days in there and then you realize its like taking a vacation in your walk
in closet
Look people I know its NY and space is limited but there are many many more hotels at this price range with more space
The staff was very nice except a guy at the front desk I believe his name was Antonio he seemed very condescending and fake (this is the way I could describe his manner) not the kind of service I'd expect from this kind of hotel
Also they do not offer 24hr room service as advertised I called down for food and they told me it would take 45 minutes I asked why so long and they told me they had to order it from a diner and it gets delivered to the front desk
When I finally received my food it wasn't it warm never mind hot and it was horrible food not what I would expect from a "4 star" hotel but they still charged me like it was even though I could have just as well ordered it myself and saved money
The only thing good about this place was the bellmen (who were very friendly every time I went in and out and really had personality they didn't seem to be putting on an act) and the hot cider in the lobby otherwise avoid this place
