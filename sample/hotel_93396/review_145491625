Great room, service, location and hotel! Stayed in the James Dean Suite, beautiful room with bottle of wine (actually a decent one unlike some hotels' "welcome wine"...) and truffles upon arrival. Perfect location close to many sights, but also on a quiet street so you can escape from the headache of Times Square, etc when you want to. A small hotel, but it's all about quality vs quantity at this place.
