I stayed at the Iroquois July 1st to 4th and I just have positive things to say about the Hotel
The hotel with it's d√©cor and atmosphere is a welcoming place to go too
We where greeted with a smile by everyone we crossed
Checking in was fast and effective
The room we where assigned to was Clean and confortable which is what a woman looks for in a room
The room was a fair size considering we are in New York city and that we go there to sleep
The restaurant in the hotel as wonderful food
Now let's talk about Location
People say "Location
Location
Location" and with the Iroquois you get the package deal as we are close to a lot of the most popular attraction Empire State Building
Rockerfeller center
Broadway theatre
This hotel is just great and I can't wait to go back to New York and stay there again
