Nice hotel, very clean, centrally located, excellent service.
We had a suite which was spacy and nicely decorated, in a modern, american style, no frills, no gold. Very good bed and shower, silent in the night.
The AC was working fine. The staff was friwnly and gave us excellent recommendations.
Drawbacks: too small wardrobe, breakfastroom not very inviting
