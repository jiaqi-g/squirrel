This hotel is well located in Midtown
a few doors up from the Algonquin
It is an attractive old
style building and the two room suite we had was excellent
It even had windows that opened which allowed for the sounds of the city to lull us to sleep
No breakfast was provided but you are in New York
There are lots of diners and cafes around and there is a grocery store around the corner on 6th Ave where you can stock up on supplies
It is a couple of blocks away from the subway
The staff were friendly and helpful
We all really liked it
