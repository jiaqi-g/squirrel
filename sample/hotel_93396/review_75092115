The Iroquois New York was highly recommended to us by a friend and we were certainly not disappointed. With the innumerous hotels in NYC choosing one can be a daunting task. What a fantastic hotel! After a full day of sightseeing, coming back to the Iroquois was such a relief. It was warm, welcoming and unbelievably comfortable. The frette linens, robes, comfortable beds, decor and personable staff made for a wonderful experience. 
We have since recommeded The Iroquois to friends who loved it as much as we did. On future trips to NYC we will absolutely stay at The Iroquois! A special thanks to Alex the night manager for helping to make our stay so wonderful.
