We stayed at the Iroquois for over a week for during a spring getaway. The hotel exceeded expectations at every step. This was our third trip to the Big Apple and each time we have stayed at notable hotels, so we had high expectations, The Iroquois delivered on each one. We had a quiet, secluded room on the 8th floor...an important consideration for Manhattan!
From the luxury bathrobes and Molten Brown bath items to the little freebees like the New York Times and coffee / citrus water, we were made to feel like royalty each day. Our free internet access was excellent, despite what others had noted, so we appreciated the ability to keep our friends and family updated on our trip each night. As with anything in Manhattan, the consideration must be "location, location, location" and the Iroquois was by far the best situated hotel we have stayed in to date. We were able to walk to many locations with ease including Rockefeller Center, Macy's, Grand Central, and even Central Park, saving lots of $$$ in cab fares. West 44th has many hidden gems and we enjoyed the local restaurants and bars located on our street. Very upscale feel.
