The hotel is located in Midtown Manhattan on 44th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues
It is only about two blocks from the small
but beautiful Bryant Park
The taxi ride from JFK is a flat $45 plus $5 toll and tip
It is a relatively small hotel sharing a narrow street with the Sofitel and another hotels as well as a diner and a few restaurants
including the Triomphe which is the hotel's restaurant and where room service comes from
I cannot comment on the food because I did not eat any of it
However
the Triomphe was rated high by Zagat (average of about 23 or so)
The Internet worked intermittently
but no different from anywhere else in the USA
The staff were uncaring and barely helpful
when the doorman opened the door for us I overheard him saying to another staff member
"You know Jose only made $20 in tips?" That is just not classy
At night
there was no staff at the desk or no doorman
so security is a bit of a concern
There was a video camera installed in the elevator
but I think people can use the staircase from the first floor
The guy who was there at night was not very friendly or even really tried to be helpful
The concierge was only seen a few times during the day
The deluxe room was very nice with an old New York feel to it
However
it was a bit cramped New York
When you go use the toilet and leave the door open
for example
you have to pee sideways because the door blocks your way
the shower/bathtub is an older type in which you need to pull all the way to get proper water pressure and then push a metal stick to have the water come out of the showerhead
The bathroom amenities were alright though
Our rooms faced the courtyard which had a noisy airconditioning system or some kind of machine that hummed loudly all day
The lobby is like a mix between a classic New York pub and someone's living room (there is a den with computer)
The price of the hotel jumped up to double when we tried to add extra nights
So I think we got a very good deal
The manager was helpful and negotiated a lower rate for us which was nice of her
SUMMARY: This is a four star hotel in quality of the rooms
but I think the service could be much better
It was really lacking when we were there and so I want to give this hotel three and a half stars overall
I would stay somewhere else before choosing the Iroquois Hotel again
