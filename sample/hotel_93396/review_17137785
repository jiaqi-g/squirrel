Stayed at the Iroquois for one night in June, 2008. The property is on a great centrally street - West 44th - Sofitel and Algonquin hotels are nearby. Close to Rockefeller Center and Times Square (without being too close), it is easy to walk, grab a cab or take the subway to anywhere you want to go. The rooms are a decent size by Manhattan standards with room to move around in the bathroom, decent closet and storage space, a nice working desk and LCD wall mounted TV. The in room alarm clock also has an I-Pod docking station which is a nice add on touch. The front desk, concierge and doorman were all very helpful, personable and pleasant to talk with. I would stay at this property again.
