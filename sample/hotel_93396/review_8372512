We loved this hotel
At $300 a night
it was more than I really wanted to pay
but it turned out to be worth it
For one thing
my husband fell ill and spent a lot of time in the room
It was nice for him to have a comfortable bed
a decent
sized room
and free DVDs to watch
My little boy loved the kid
sized robe and "Batman" bubble bath they gave us
And when I accidentally left my carry
on bag (with crucial stuff like my laptop) in the lobby when we left
the staff found it
figured out it belonged to me
and managed to call our airport
limo driver with enough time for us to turn around
get back to the hotel to fetch the bag
and still get to the airport in time for our international flight
That's good service
In our five nights at the Iroquois
we found the location excellent
the hotel restaurant superb
the staff friendly and helpful
and the room well
appointed and quiet
The bigger hotels can be more glamorous
but here we felt at home
