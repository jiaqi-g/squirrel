First: there was no doorman
although there are stairs to reach the door
Normally this isn't an issue
but I was coming from a conference and had a box of materials
a large suitcase
and two bags
so I could've used some customer service as I stumbled up the stairs slowly
At first I just thought the doorman had stepped away at that moment and it was poor timing
but I didn't see anyone there all night
Second: I plugged in my laptop
walked away
when I came back I realized the outlet at the desk is bad and my computer was dead dead
I checked everywhere and the only outlet that works in the room is in the bathroom
so my laptop sat on top of the toilet for a couple hours
Third: The space is already very tight
to be expected for a NYC hotel
but the minibar is absolutely gigantic
It's obviously there strictly for profit
and not for concern for me
If that piece of furniture were gone
I would not lose value
and the space would be lovely
Fourth: They have satellite
so although the rain outside isn't that bad I am currently without tv
Fifth: The fire escape is right next to my window
As a woman
I don't feel entirely secure with this setup
