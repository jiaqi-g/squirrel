I brought my son to NYC for his 18th birthday
We have stayed in a lot of different hotels in the Midtown
TImes Square areas over the years
and I always wanted to try the Iroquois
When we checked in around 1 PM
our room was ready
The room itself was tiny with barely enough room to move around in
but it was clean
with a nice bathroom
and a beautiful
comfy bed
It was hot out and the A/C was great
Our room was at the back of the hotel and extremely quiet
The location was good
on a quiet street but within walking distance to everything
Turndown service at night was very nice
Would have liked to see fresh iced tea in the lobby but once it was empty
it didn't appear to get refilled at all
All in all
a nice small hotel with good service
would recommend for couples or singles due to the size of the rooms
