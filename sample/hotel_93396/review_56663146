We thoroughly enjoyed our stay this past week
The hotel is on a quiet street a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and is very convenient to shopping
theater
Staff members were warm
welcoming
and helpful when answering questions or giving directions
As a boutique hotel
the lobby was small
However
there is a nice little "library" with a few comfortable chairs
newspapers
and two computers (with internet access) off the lobby
Our room (a "Classic Room" with two double beds) and the bathroom were smallish but immaculately clean and well
appointed
We had requested a quiet room
away from the street and elevators The room faced a back alley and another building; window coverings included a good quality blackout shade and nice wooden blinds
so privacy was never an issue
We had a problem with our thermostat
which was promptly fixed by a call to the front desk
The beds were extremely comfortable
with several pillow choices and nice linens (Frette)
Maid service was unobtrusive and included an evening turn
down service
with replenishment of towels and toiletries
The complimentary shoe shine service was nice and the New York Times was delivered to our door each morning
Enjoyed fruit smoothies
coffee
and muffins at Gregory's Coffee (across the street) for breakfast each morning
With an online promotion
this was an excellent value
We will definitely return
