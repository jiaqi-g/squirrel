Midtown manhattan is not my best location
unless proximity to times square is important
But we stayed for 4 nights in this hotel
in this small luxury hotel group member
The reception area is a bit dark and foreboding
and it didn't quite have the upmarket luxury i was expecting
But it was very quiet
unexpectedly
as we overlooked 44th street
and very comfortable
But we loved it for the concierge service
Having visited NY many times
we had a concierge who was brimming with new ideas
all of them good
and who hugely contributed to our stay
Vanessa ( and colleague Alan) organised our days to provide variety
and fun experiences
and there was always a huge queue for their time
such was the smile and the popularity
