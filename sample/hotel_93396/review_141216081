Absolutely wonderful experience at The Iroquois. The location is second to none, with Times Square and 5th Avenue seconds away and Central Park a 10 minute walk. The area always felt safe, even when returning to the hotel late at night. Iroquois Hotel staff were exceptional - friendly, knowledgeable, welcoming and efficient. Given our extended stay we were upgraded to a Deluxe Room which was spacious enough (for the location), very clean and tastefully decorated. The bed was also really, really comfortable! Major bonus points for the Molten Brown toiletries. Thanks to all at The Iroquois for an amazing vacation, we can't wait to come back.
