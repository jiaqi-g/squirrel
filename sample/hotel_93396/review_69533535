I think it's all be said before
Great location
really comfortable beds
friendly staff
I don't think we got the tipping right
but still really helpful staff
There's a coffee shop over the road that does a good on the run kind of breakfast
and lots of places to eat especially if you head over to 9th Avenue and head up couple of blocks
Good (not great but good) Thai called Breeze amongst others
