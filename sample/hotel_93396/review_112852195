My partner and I stayed at the Iroquois in May this year for 6 nights. Good points: The hotels location is great: central to everything. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. The lobby is small but this allows a chic feel to the place. The decor is nice (not dated). The room was clean and serviced daily to a high standard. Loved the chocs on our pillows: nice touch.
The bad points: Our room was literally next door to the gym. On one hand it was great on the other we could hear each person going in and out of the gym, very early in the morning (5am on two occasions and 2am on another). Conversations outside our room door. There was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. The room was very small. I had to have a daily tidy to contain clothes etc. There was not enough electricity power for my straightners to work (there was in a neighbouring hotel when I stayed the previous year). The wifi was problematic as although free it only worked outside of our room (on occassions by the exit door). Our room veiw..........well not the nicest........we could see straight into three other rooms! My advice is unless you don't care about people watching you keep the blinds down.
