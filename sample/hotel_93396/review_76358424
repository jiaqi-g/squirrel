Very nice, elegant hotel. Located on a quiet section of 44th street and in walking distace to Times Square. The Hotel is not very big but that adds to the charm and the coziness. We stayed in a deluxe King room on the 7th floor facing a court yard and another building. The room was small but very nicely decorated and very elegant. The bed was very comfortable and gave us a great night sleep. We really enjoyed having the black out shades so we could sleep in as long as we wanted. The room AC did not keep the room as cold as we like but is was comfortable. The bath room is quite small and only has room for one person to get ready, but it has great gold fixtures and classy tile. To be honest the smallness really is not a big deal. The room has a large flat screen TV and DVD player, you can even check out DVDs from the front desk for free. Overall we really enjoyed the room. 
The hotel does not have ice machines in the hallway so you have to call room service for a bucket of ice, this was some what of a pain but it is managable. The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs and the conceriage was the best. We even called them from lower Manhattan to get help finding a bank and they were more than willing to help us out.
Overall we had a great stay and really enjoyed the hotel. Also, if you want coffee in the morning there is a great coffee shop across the street called Gregory's, this will save you a 1-2 block walk to Starbucks and to be honest it was better coffee.
