My daughter and I stayed at The Iroquois for a week last month and we couldn't fault this Hotel in any way! We travel a lot and have had many hotel experiences, however, The Iroquois is definitely second to none! The rooms are very spacious given the prime position of this Hotel and have been refurbished without sparing any expense. The marble bathroom is simply divine and the amenities that this Hotel afford are more than generous. The library area off the main entrance is also divine. 
The room service meal that we enjoyed on our first night after a long day of travelling to NYC was five star as was their Restaurant. We have found a regular stomping ground for our future visits to NY and we would not stay anywhere else upon our return! 
Last but not least the staff are extremely friendly and the Manager of this Hotel is very much "hands on" and wants only the best for the Hotel guests! K. Berkhout, Australia
