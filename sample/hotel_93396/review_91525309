The hotel was situated perfectly between Times Square and Grand Central Terminal. The staff was incredibly accomodating and friendly. The room was immaculate - from linens to bathroom and fixtures, albeit small (it's New York!) and looking out into a brick wall (it's New York!!). My wife and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary with this trip and The Iroquois was the perfect setting for our celebration. We are already planning our return trip - and the Iroquois will be our hotel of choice again.
