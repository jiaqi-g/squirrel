A great small hotel
just three minutes walk from Times Square and even closer to 5th Avenue
My wife & I stayed four nights and felt almost like part of the hotel's family when we left
The staff were all very friendly and helpful
The rooms are really comfortable
though not huge
The bathroom was excellent
Next time we visit New York we will definitely stay here again
