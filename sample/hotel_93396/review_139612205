A small "boutique" hotel but without the truly boutique features
It's an adequate average hotel with small rooms and tiny bathrooms even for NY
Comfortable bed but noisy ac
no coffee maker or kettle and no curtains
Shower standard within bath
As I said
Not really boutique
Service was fine and it was good to use the gym restroom and shower before leaving
Guys on the entrance doors did everything other than hold the doors open
Idle chat to their mates seemed the order of the day
Go take a walk up to the Setai on 5th and see how it should be done is my suggestion to them
Would I return ? Only if most other usual options in this price bracket were unavailable
