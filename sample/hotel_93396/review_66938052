The hotel is in a reasonable location - just a bit too far from the subway for extreme weather. The rooms are tiny. Cupboard and bathroom space are at a premium which requires organisation if you have belongings for more than a couple of nights. The room was clean and the bed extraordinarily comfortable. Nothwithstanding that I had a room facing the street, it was not too noisy. The split lift system is very annoying.
In respect of the service that other reviewers rave about - I must have stayed at another hotel. I checked in at 11 and the room wasn't ready. Went out and returned at 2.50pm and the room was still not ready. Concierge was not particularly helpful or knowledgeable. I was charged for a mini bar item I didn't consume - must have been because I put a small yoghurt in the fridge. 
If the price were right I would stay at the hotel again.
