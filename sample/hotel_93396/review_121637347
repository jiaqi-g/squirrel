This was our first trip to NYC in a long time and was a Christmas gift from my husband so I could see all the store Christmas windows
Rockefeller Center
skate on the Rockefeller Rink
and visit Bryant Park
I got to choose the hotel and I decided on the Iroquois
From the moment we arrived until our departure home
the hotel staff was warm
friendly
very helpful
interested in us
what we were doing and where we were going
and very happy to provide recommendations for restaurants
travel routes
which store windows to visit
and anything else we needed help with
They called our room the first night in to make sure everything was satisfactory
and when we asked for ice to be sent to our room
it arrived in less than 5 minutes
The location was perfect
We walked everywhere
all the way south to Macy's (most beautiful Christmas windows
) up to South Central Park
We would absolutely stay here again when we return to NYC to visit
It will be like revisiting family
