My college girlfriends and I planned to meet in the city for a little reunion and a lot of fun. The Iroquois was responsible for most of the fun. First of all, the staff was so unbelievably friendly and accommodating, from the bellmen, to the receptionists, to the bartender to housekeeping, everyone helped make our stay so wonderful, we felt like a group of queens from the moment we walked in the door, until we left the next day. 
The rooms were immaculate, the mattresses were like sleeping on clouds and the Frette sheets and bathrobes and Molten Brown bath products were a perfect touch.
We had the most delicious drinks and appetizers at the bar before heading off to dinner. The pan seared scallops with porcini mushroom and foie gras butter was TO DIE FOR! The bartender even came over to our table and re-shook my martini when I was just halfway through - talk about attentive!!! 
We all had such a great time and felt so welcomed, instead of going out after dinner, we returned to the Iroquios bar to finish off the night, where we were able to enjoy each other's company as well as the service of first-class boutique hotel. 
I've traveled a great deal and stayed in many hotels and this one certainly stands out among the rest. It's a small hotel, but they skimp on nothing! Thanks for a truly fabulous weekend Iroquois, we'll be back!!!
