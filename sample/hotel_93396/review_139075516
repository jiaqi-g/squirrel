This Hotel has an excellent location right in the theater district. You can esentially walk to any Broadway Theater Production. 
The Hotel itself is small and very clean. .The rooms are updated, well appointed and the bathrooms are very nice- done all in granite. The rooms are on the smalll side- but this is typical of New York city where a large room is either rare or very very expensive.
The Hotel is on the quiet side. We found this to be a positive but if you prefer an establishment that is buzzing, this may not be for you..
The French Restaurant at the Hotel was closed at the time of our visit. This was the one major disappointment of our visit. We had eaten in the restaurant seveal times befoe which is how we discovered the Hotel. When we made the reservation to stay at the hotel, we were not notified that the Triomphe Restaurant would be under renovation during our stay; we would have preferred to have known this in advance.
Since we booked by e mail, it would have been thoughtful if the Hotel would have let us know of this temporary disruption in advance.
