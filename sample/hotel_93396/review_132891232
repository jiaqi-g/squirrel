My husband and I stayed at the Iroquios for one night with our two children (ages 11 and 9) in April 2012. The concierge, Sergio, was friendly and patient and helped to direct us in our sightseeing and restaurant searching. The room was nicely decorated and clean. It was small, but fine for a short stay. The bathroom was also clean and updated. The location was great - near Times Square, Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, etc. I think the location on 44th St also contributed to a quiet room. The price was affordable for a family visiting NYC. We will return to the Iroquios. We did not have elavator or water problems as some other reviews had reported.
