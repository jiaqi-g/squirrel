The Iroquois was a phenomenal hotel
It had a good location (two blocks away from time square) extremely friendly staff fantastic service and cozy rooms
Every day your corner of your bed gets turned and they leave a card with the weather on it for the next day
The concierges
Sergio and Vanessa
were amazingly helpful with whatever you needed
I would defiantly stay here again
