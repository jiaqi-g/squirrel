Very nice small hotel with an excellent bar and restaurant. Staff is great. Service is great. Rooms a bit small (especially the bathroom and shower) but decorated nicely (great use of space). Strongly recommend dinner at their restaurant and drinks at the bar. On a very cold winter weekend, this hotel was warm and welcoming (both literally and figuratively). Look forward to staying there again.
