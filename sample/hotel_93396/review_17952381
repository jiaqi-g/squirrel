The Iroquois is a beautiful small hotel situated within easy walking distance from Times Square, however far enough away to be more peaceful than Times Square. (2 blocks?) The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. Comfortable beds and pillows. The staff was helpful and friendly. I will definitely stay there again when I visit NYC.
