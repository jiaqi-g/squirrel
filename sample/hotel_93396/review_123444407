We stayed in this adorable Midtown hotel
From the moment we met our doorman we loved it
Vanessa
was an excellent Concierge
She knows all the best places
Our room was adorable and everything worked in the room
At the end of our trip they brought a vaccum cleaner so my room so that I could use my space
at no extra charge
They treated us like we were the only guests there
All the staff were lovely
It was awesome :)
