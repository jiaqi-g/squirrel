Just returned from a week's stay interrupted for two nights [went to woodstock] . Avoid the 11th fkoor inward rooms [not the ones on 44th st] as the noise of the outside compressors pours into and engulfs the room, especially at night time. We informed the staff about this. We hope the hotel manages to remedy this inconvenience.
On returning we were upgraded to a suite which was what a suite should be; tastefully furnished and decorated, spacious and peaceful. What a contrast!
The piece de resistance however are the staff. They were helpful, courteous, attentive and professional.
Overall. if midtown is your destination the hotel is highly recommeded.
