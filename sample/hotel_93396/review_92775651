I Booked a Night at the Iroquis for the evening of Dec
Which was the night of the first big blizzard of the 2010
2011 winter
The Accomodations could have not been better
First off we were greeted by Timmy the doorman who took all our bags
Parking was a snap as there is a garage across the street
We were in walking distance to Times square and Toys r Us which was perfect for the children
The Hotel staff was pleasant and accomodating
We stayed in the Presidential suite with an adjoining room as we have 3 small children
There was a total of 3 tvs with 3 dvd players so we were all able to watch what we wanted with out fighting
There is also a wonderful selection of dvds for loan at the front desk
We felt completely warm and cozy on such a snowy cold night in New York
In the morning we awoke to a complimentary news paper outside our door
The in room snacks and mini bar was perfect for satisfying bed time snacks for the kids and us adults
Upon checkout we were greted by a Gentleman Named Robert Holmes Who Stated he was the hotel manager and asked us if we had enjoyed our stay
and I was pleased to say
yes sir we sure did
All in all The hotel and all of its staff
even down to the woman who came to turn the beds down at night were completely friendly and accomodating
In all the hotel was clean the beds were comfortable the staff was friendly
I would highly recommend staying at this hotel as I will be booking here on my next trip to NYC
