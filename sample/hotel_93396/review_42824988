The location is just perfect. As is typical of NYC hotels, some rooms are a little small but all are very clean and well maintained with great amenities. Ask for a room with new windows (noise reducing windows!). There is a a great gym too. Staff were friendly and helpful at all times. Coming back to the Iroquois after a day of sightseeing in NYC was like coming home: Comfy, cozy and very welcoming. We will definately stay here again and have already recommended it to a friend visiting NYC later this year. You won't be disappointed.
