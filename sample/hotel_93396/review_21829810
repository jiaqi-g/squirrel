It was time to leave the spouses behind and we girls decided to stay at The Iroquois, as it was exceptionally priced at one of the travel websites and a very convenient base to see the main sights. My girlfriend's first extended visit to New York City and The Iroquois made it memorable. Many thanks to Alex, who graciously upgraded our Classic Room to an Executive Suite! We stayed one night in the Classic and it was quite adequate-- clean, a good size for a NYC hotel room. Comfortable bed, fluffy towels and bathrobes and quiet. I didn't hear any noise in the hallway or from other rooms. The Suite was heavenly with a spacious living room, sofa set, desk, flat screen TV, BOSE mp3 player, complimentary half bottle of wine and sparkling water. Once again, exceptionally clean surroundings with that incredibly comfortable bed, flat screen TVr; marble bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Turndown service was consistent with chocolates and weather card. There's a wonderful complimentary shoe shine service and that person does a great job!! We did attempt to order room service one morning and our card was not picked up; the next morning, however, breakfast was delivered promptly. Reasonable price for that breakfast, too. The entire staff is professional and pleasant. There's coffee available in the main lobby in the mornings and I could honestly say, that renovation of that lobby is finished (to give an update based on other travelers' info). This is not a large hotel (which I love) and I was extremely pleased with our stay. I recommend it highly.
