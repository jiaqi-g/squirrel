We arrived at the hotel from Europe at 11pm and received a warm welcome from the front desk. We were escorted to our room which had 2 double beds . It was small but clean and well appointed . We had trouble getting the safe to work but they sent a maintenance guy to see us at midnight. The bathroom is very elegant but also small. Taking a bath was out of the question as it was tiny. Housekeeping were also great and never disturbed us. They left bottled water every day and the weather card at turndown is a lovely touch.
The staff are excellent and always greeted us by name. However, they were not overbearing as can sometimes happen in smaller hotels. The location is perfect and the hotel has doormen who provided us with umbrellas , maps and were very helpful.
There is a computer available to use in the lobby and you can check flight information in real time.
It is located on a quiet street so we never heard any traffic. In fact we never heard the other guestd in the hallway either, the rooms seem to be very well sound-proofed.
This hotel feels like a private European mansion and it's easy to forget that you are in the heart of Manhattan. I'm looking foward to going back.
