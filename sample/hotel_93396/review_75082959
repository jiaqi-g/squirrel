We stayed at The Iroquois in July 2010, and I have to say that you cannot do better for location or value in NYC. We booked via Expedia and after a lot of searching this was the only 4 star midtown hotel we found within our price range.
After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, we booked this hotel and it was a fantastic experience. Close to Times Square, Grand Central Station, Macy's, Rockefeller Center, etc. The room was small, but perfect. Absolutely quiet, and of a very high standard. I especially liked the bathroom, and all the little luxuries provided. 
I also have to mention the service, really exceptional. I think American service is some of the best I experienced in our round-the-world trip, and The Iroquois would have been some of the best we experienced in the US.
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
