I have to agree with a previous review
great location
nice staff
but that is it really
Breakfast not included
attached bar (not really a hotel bar) no atmosphere and pricey
Sauna was never on
2 lifts
both very slow
we were on the 3rd floor (2nd in english) and had to walk up and down the stairs all the time
not a prob for us
but not good
Room was horrid
Very small
just room to walk round the bed
We couldn't tell if it was day or night out
very disconcerting
window pointless as was up against the brick wall of the next building
AC was loud
I had to use ear plugs to sleep
If you didn't close the bathroom door you had to sit sideways on the loo
and couldn't get to the toilet paper
No tea/coffee maker
You go to NY for the views
I was very disappointed to be staying in a cave
it felt like being underground
