We have been visiting NYC for over 30 years and this was our first stay at The Iroquois
To say that we were thrilled with the experience would be an understatement
Our request for an early check
in was cheerfully accommodated
Every staff member we encountered was friendly
cheerful and courteous
The room was absolutely perfect
It was spotless
the furnishings were lovely and the bed and linens were so comfortable
The street view was an added bonus
The bathroom was also spotless and supplied with enough towels to last for days
The hotel is a quiet retreat from nearby Times Square and Grand Central
This will certainly be our hotel of choice for future visits
