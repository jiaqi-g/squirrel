We spent four nights at the Iroquios on our recent trip to New York
we originally found the hotel on Trip Advisor and booked on the strength on the reviews
The hotel was everything we needed for a perfect holiday
clean
fantastic staff and located in an area where its only a short walk to Time Square
Broadway
Fifth Avenue
the Rockerfeller Centre
Previous reviews criticized the size of the rooms but we found them to be perfect and just what is required
you don't want to spend all your time in New York in your hotel room in any case
For a quiet
quality hotel to see the sights
you won't go far wrong with the Iroquois
