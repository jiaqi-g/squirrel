To me, the Iroquois seems like a 5 star hotel in a 4 star size. The service is friendly but very professional. It is true that I have stayed in larger rooms elsewhere, but nowhere were they furnished more sumptuously. The location is perfect, and the food in Triomphe, the restaurant off the lobby, is to die for. One reason I'll look forward to coming back to NY is to return to the Iroquois.
