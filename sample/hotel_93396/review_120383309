We recently stayed for 3 nights and having stayed at many of the larger 5 star hotels in the city, decided to try something smaller and more personal. It absolutely matched expectations and reviews by other trip advisors, so thanks to everyone who raved about this place...I agree.
Service very friendly and personal. Something quite nice about the coziness of the reception area versus the large terminal size lobbys of larger hotels. Didnt eat at the hotel, as it is so centrally located there are loads of places nearby, but prices looked very reasonable for a NY hotel. For breakfast head to the Red Flame diner just down the street full of tourists but also lots of locals come in. Complimentary coffee available in the hotel lobby from 7am was a nice touch. 
We stayed in a suite, which was perfect for us, but it want ostentatious and overly stuffed with useless amenties, but it was a nice comfortable space. 
My only 2 minor whinges:
1) the fact that the curtains don't close, there are wooden blinds, but these really didnt block out the street lights or sunlight
2) we were on the 11th floor but we could hear every person walking down the street and it was very noisy...if you are a light sleeper, you will struggle with a street facing room and will need to ask for an inner room (I will be next time!)
Was very impressed with the speed with which the concierge rustled up a limo to the airport at peak rush hour..literally minutes. A really good limo rate, they didnt throw on a huge hotel mark-up which was a real first for NY.
Definitely will return and make this my hotel of choice in NY for future stays.
