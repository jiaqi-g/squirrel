My sisters and I celebrated my mom's 80th birthday over a May weekend at The Iroquois and, as my mom describes it, it was truly a weekend she will never forget. First of all, the hotel is magnificent! It is warm, elegant and inviting (plus it is convenient to both Fifth Avenue and the Theatre District). Secondly, the staff is extremely accommodating and went above and beyond to make my mom's birthday a memorable one. They arranged for the six of us to have a beautiful suite plus 2 adjoining superior rooms which were all very lovely and comfortable (the beds were EXTREMELY comfortable). We had ordered a couple of bottles of champagne, a fruit platter and a cheese platter to be delivered to mom's suite before her arrival, which they were, and a short time later, after we polished off the champagne, a staff member arrived to deliver a complementary bottle of wine and a box of chocolates, which was a nice surprise. The service was impeccable! The staff was extremely attentive and did everything they could to ensure we were happy. I have stayed at 5-star hotels before, i.e., the Peninsula, and find The Iroquois to be in the same league. For a truly memorable experience, plan to stay at The Iroquois. My family and I highly recommend it and will definitely return.
