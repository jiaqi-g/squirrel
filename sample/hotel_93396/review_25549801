Stayed Feb 27
Iroquois met and exceeded our expectations
We wanted a nice boutique hotel within walking distance from Time Square and we got it
We stayed in room 808
a classic 2
double bed room
It was a comfortable size albeit smaller than the chain hotels
We had no problems with it
The room had every amenity we needed
Service was excellent from the friendly doormen
the front desk and the concierge
They even have DVDs to borrow and play in the room
My teenager loved that and the ipod dock for her music
Our room was in the back
we heard no traffic noise or any from other guests
Beds were amazingly comfortable
Nice 24
hour fitness room with a sauna
We did not eat in the hotel restaurant
had breakfast at the Red Flame down the street and ate at the Tratorria dopo Teatro in the next block
