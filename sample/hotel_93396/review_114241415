We stayed at the Iroquois because it was close to the theatre district
and within a reasonable walk to my husband's office
I had read all the reviews on
which were positive
and knew it was a member of the Small Luxury Hotels Group
so I was not too surprised when we walked into the rather simple
small lobby
It is not a place to see and be seen; if you want that
try one of the many other large hotels in the area
It was clean
with a lived
in look
By that
I mean not modern or high
and with the bonus of friendly not snobby staff
Our room had all the right moving parts
but it was very small
Aside from the welcome gift of fruit
and chocolates
there was a large flat screen TV
comfy bed
and a chair
but as two people we felt a bit cramped
We had to be creative about placing our suitcases in spaces that would not block anything
(One went into the closet
and the other behind the bathroom door
) There was free Wi
movie CDs at the front desk
and free morning newspaper of our choice
The bathroom was very clean
and had Molton Brown bath products
plenty of Frette towels and robes
and a well
placed mag mirror
The shower was nice and strong
but when I showered late in the morning
it took a very long time for the hot water to come up
(My husband said his shower was fine
) There was a modern AC unit in the room that was efficient
but not silent
It did act as white noise to drown out the noise of the city
which is certainly a factor at certain times of the day no matter where you stay
Let me also say that because this is an older building
it is quiet
There was no flushing noise
loud echoes from the hallway
or sounds from next door in the middle of the night
Some of that can also be attributed to the lack of convention and large group clients
but it is certainly a plus
Triomphe
the restaurant connected to the hotel is lovely
We had pre
theatre dinner there one night
and enjoyed every bite
This highly rated small gem of a restaurant is soothing
with attentive service and a sophisticated french menu
We did not try their breakfast
but from the looks of the fresh
squeezed juice we saw when checking out
I think it would have been a treat
Would we go back
probably
I think we'd try to get a larger room
if it was not too expensive
Our rate was reasonable compared to other hotels
and we were not there to be in the room too much
but for the convenience
It is close to the subways
major shopping avenues
Broadway and many restaurants
When you list your priorities
The Iroquois comes out looking like a good choice
