I was one of those who had no electricity after Sandy - so moved to this hotel after having stayed at another hotel for 3 days. All I can say is that I truly wish I had come here first! What a brilliant find! Im not really crazy about the area around Times Square - as it can be a bit hectic, but honestly, would overlook that for Iroquois. Service is superb , rooms are cozy ( feels like you are in your own bedroom)...and everything was just spot on. Unfortunately - I didn't get to taste any of the food - but will save that for next time. This hotel is definitely worth a visit.
