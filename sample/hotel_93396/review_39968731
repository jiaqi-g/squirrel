I stayed here for 2 nights and had a great experience. It is about a block from Time Square, about 5-7 walk to the subway, 2 minute walk to the convenience store and just overall centrally located. The beds were so comfortable and the bathrooms were very nice. The staff was so nice and always eager to help. There is also a restaurant attached to the hotel, Triomphe, which I've read received great reviews but we didn't get a chance to eat there. There is also a little diner a few hundred feet away. They also offered room service, which we got one night because we were so tired to walk around anymore. Of course, room service was expected to be high. We paid a total of $21 for a sandwich, chips and a salad. Another added extra was that someone came to turn down the beds each night if you wanted. The one and only problem I had was that the internet was a little slow. I would definitely return here.
