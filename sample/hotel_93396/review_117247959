Stayed at iroquois July 2010 and just returned after four nights August 2011
Better than last year
From check
in to check
out our stay was delightful
Very central for our plans of shopping and theatre
King room
friendly and wonderful staff
A very special thank you to Concierge Vanessa for going above and beyond
You certainly are a great asset to the Iroquois
For us the Iroquois has become the "go to place" in NYC
See you in the fall of 2012
