The good: This is a very fine hotel for a reasonable price & with a central location about halfway between Grand Central trains & Port Authority buses
If you book early and stay more than 3 nights
you get a good discount
Staff were friendly & tried to please
The bedding is fantastic & the showers are good
Our 9th floor room (901) was quiet
day & night
Free wi
fi was nice
as was the coffee/hot apple cider welcoming guests back in the lobby
The bad: rooms are small
views are limited
There isn't a fridge but you can request one (same for ice)
Breakfast is not included but there are many cheaper alternatives to the dining room all around
The 2 computers in the library are free but one seems half
Conclusion: We also stayed one block away in the Millennium Broadway for a similar price
Althought the Millennium was flashier looking & had superb 44th floor views of Chrysler bldg & Times Square
the Iroquois had a homely feel that will keep me going back when in town
