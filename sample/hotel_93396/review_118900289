It's the third time that I come in NY and I would like to thanks all staff of the Iroquois hotel
the 'custumer service' was perfect
Check
in pleasant (in NYC is unusual
)
The size of the room is correct
but glitch noise insulation windows
Very good bathrobes + towels changes every days
Every night

Thank's at all for this super service
