Stayed here for the first time as hotels I usually use in NYC were all full
Thoughts :
great location
On W44th between 5th and 6th
a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a few mins walk from Times Square
but W44th is not the noisiest street so good from that perspective
boutique feel
It's small in NYC hotel terms
and perhaps lacks some of the facilities as a result
but is also friendlier than many
Staff are great
the room I had was inward facing and had no view at all (a wall obscured part of the window
could not even tell what the weather was like
seriously)
However
this also meant the room was quiet
not always the case in NYC
room was pretty small
Was fine for me travelling solo but would've been cramped if shared
I don't know if this was typical of rooms in the hotel but I suspect it was
room was otherwise v nice
Quality fittings
nice linen
looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries
with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room
wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC
could save you $20/day
room service menu is very limited
although food (from Triomphe
the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered
First room service menu I've seen that had no club sandwich and no fries
the hotel has a tiny gym and sauna
The gym
although v small
has enough kit in decent condition for a sensible workout and it was unusual to see anyone else in there
I didn't visit the bar but it looked lively and has a good reputation for cocktails and atmosphere
free coffee in the lobby
Perfectly nice place to stay for a few days on business and very conveniently located
but room size
gym size and limitations of room service menu means I'll probably revert to my preferred hotel next time
although I wouldn't mind staying here again
Rates are comparable
