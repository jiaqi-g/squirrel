Please forgive the spelling. Consegies (merely a guess) Alan made our trip one of a life time. His most kind help and his natural fiendly nature was one of the hotels best assests. The entire staff could not have been better. The rooms were just the right mixture of up scale cozy and historical presence. 
I asure anyone you can not find a finer establishment that will cater to your every need, only different ones.
Thank you Alan and the enitre staff. From this point forward you are now my New York Address. Please hold my mail I will see in 4 weeks.
