My 11 yr old daughter and I stayed at the Iroquois for 2 nights and loved it
The staff are warm and helpful
It is next door to the Algonquin where we visited their famous cat Mathilda
Walking distance to all Broadway shows
1 block from 6th Ave subway lines
Our room looked out on a lovely outdoor patio seating area next door and was very quiet for NYC because we were in the back of the hotel
The small library off of the lobby had a computer available for guests so my daughter could keep in touch with her friends via g mail
There were lots of restaurants on 44th and 45th streets
from fancy french to Chipoltle and of course the Red Flame Coffee Shop
