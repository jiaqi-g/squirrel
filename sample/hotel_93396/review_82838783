Luxurious
small but very comfortable room
nice amenities of a top hotel
free internet
lovely bed with great sheets
As nice as I could have asked for
One slightly odd thing
seemed like the room
and sheets
were just a touch humid
Not wet or unpleasant
just not quite how I would have chosen
Staff was unfailingly helpful
friendly and adaptable to my requests
I had booked a cheaper
much less nice place for the weekend
The other place was unsleepably loud
so at 6am I started calling around to see who had a room available for early (very early
) checkin
Iroquois had some good last
minute rates online
They were kiind enough to let me in early for the next night (early like 8am
) so I got a little rest in the morning
and then a good sleep the night I'd booked
Would definitely go back at the discounted rate; would be reasonable at the higher rate but is above my usual budget
