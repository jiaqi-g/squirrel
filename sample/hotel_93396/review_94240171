We spent three weeks in America and our last stop was New York
from the time the front door of the Iroquois Hotel opened we were greeted with warm and friendly smiles
This boutique hotel was the best part of our holiday
The location
our room and the friendly staff was excellent
When visiting New York this will be our home away from home
