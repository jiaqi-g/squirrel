just spent 2 weeks in nyc for our honeymoon. after much research we decided to stay at the iroquois. best decision we ever made. apart from a smallish room (most in ny are) we loved everything about it. warm welcoming friendly staff made the stay a joy. walking in from the cold noisy streets, it was a joy to come into this 'oasis'. loved the hot apple cider drink after a day of trekking around. the concierge (vanessa) was a delight and couldn't do enough for us. great location, a block and a half from time square close to 5th avenue and the subway. heaps of fantastic (no too touristy) bars and restaurants. try becco and spice market.
