Just spent 2 weeks in NYC for our honeymoon
After much research we decided to stay at The Iroquois
Best decision we ever made
Apart from a smallish room (most in NY are) we loved everything about it
Warm welcoming friendly staff made the stay a joy
Walking in from the cold noisy streets
it was a joy to come into this 'oasis'
Loved the hot apple cider drink after a day of trekking around
The concierge (Vanessa) was a delight and couldn't do enough for us
Great location
a block and a half from Time Square close to 5th Avenue and the subway
Heaps of fantastic (no too touristy) bars and restaurants
Try Becco and Spice Market
