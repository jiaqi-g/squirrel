Almost faultless: Only because we had problems with our in room safe. We could not open it, despite following instructions. It was a public holiday.bank holiday and the hotel had to contact the company who made the safe, to get instructions to open it. We were nervous, as we were leaving early next AM, and being international travellers, needed our documents. All was Okay, sorted easily by security/engineering.
The beds were exceptionally comfortable, or was it that we were so so tired, from endless walking around this fantastic city.?
Cleanliness was superb......
We never ate there, but it's location meant it was easy to walk and find somewhere to eat, without much effort, being breakfast, lunch, or dinner...
We ate at the "Diner", just down the road, which was cheap, and cheerful, and gave us Aussies a taste of the NYC diner action.
Free Wifi, absolutely welcome, AND EXPECTED!
Thank You for the complimentary wine, as it was our honeymoon....
I would go back there, I would not think twice, although it is on the more exy end of the scale, even with the $AUD!
