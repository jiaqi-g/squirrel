we try to come to NYC at least for a weekend once a year
but have never stayed at this hotel before
I booked it based on price then reviews
We arrived around 1130am way before check
but the front desk said they would store our luggage until the room is ready
We didn't use valet($65/nite) since there is a parking garage directly across the street( after validation $35/nite) I thought the room was comfortable and spacious enough for us(2 adults/2kids) it was clean
the shower was hot and good water pressure
we needed extra washcloths
which came immediately after i called front desk
You can't beat the location
extremely close to Times Square
We did receive a recommendation from Bill (bellhop/doorman) for a casual dinner
he recommended HB burger on 43rd
which was great( the beer was good
if the rates stay reasonable
this may be our new favorite hotel for use in the future/great staff/helpful and attentive
