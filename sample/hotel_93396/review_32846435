The staff were very friendly at the hotel
Our room was small but very comfortable and super quiet
We had no street noise at all
This is a great location for site seeing and getting around the city
Don't pack a lot of stuff because the closet is ridiculously small
We didn't eat at the hotel but maybe next time
