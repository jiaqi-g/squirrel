We have a fabulous 3 day stay (which turned into a 6 day stay) at this independent and well run hotel in 44th street MIdtown
We were going to highly recommend this hotel before the storm
and afterwards we can only say thank goodness we stayed at this total gem in Midtown
Staff are fabulous
rooms are very comfortable (King has much more room and better large bed than standard room so recommend king rooms)
No noise from lifts or other rooms despite hotel being full
Its not trendy
its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well
The location is great
two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven
or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue
10 minute walk to Empire State
Breakfast in the hotel's restaurant "Triomphe" is too formal/staid and pricey for us but it was very good food
We had our stay extended by Superstorm Sandy and I can honestly say in 20 years of travrelling the globe we have never experienced such service and dedication as the staff showed its guests during this crisis
The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC
the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests
they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations
they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet
and despite having to sleep at work
the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat
We must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add
) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations
Patrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful
Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC
AMAZING
Total customer focus
super friendly helpful staff
and a great stay in a great location
We will always go back here when in Manhattan
