I loved my stay at The Iroquois. It was convenient to lots of spots in New York City and the hotel staff was extremely nice and helpful. The elevator in the hotel is a little slow but we stayed on the 3rd floor and took the stairs. They had the best complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning and the best hot apple cider in the evening. We hung out in the lobby and the library sipping our apple cider in the evening. It was nice to sit and talk to other people staying at the hotel. The hotel had a very home like feel and I would definitely stay there again. New York City is an amazing place. I really wish I lived there.
