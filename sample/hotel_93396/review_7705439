We were 2 old friends, almost 60, in the Big Apple for the first time. We were referred to The Iroquois hotel through one of the packaging companies that do plays/hotels. We got tickets to three of the major shows and 8 nights at the hotel. Check in was easy, very nice service and greeting. We got the rooms requested. Service all around was very very nice. Best of all was the helpfulness of the conceirge. She helped us book restaurants and other shows. Led us to great restaurants and other adventures. A big plus was the wireless internet service that was complimentary with the room. The location was absolutely perfect for our plans. We saw 5 plays in all during the 8 days, and a jazz pianist one evening. We were able to walk to all evening entertainment from the great location of the hotel. We booked prix fixed meals prior to dinner at some of the historic restaurants, 21, Sardi's. Tavern on the Green. Some really great spots. All in all we had a great time, enjoyed seeing the sights and saw great plays.
