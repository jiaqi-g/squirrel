We spent 4 nights at The Iroquois Hotel in New York. On seeing our room we was a little dissapointed, but we now realise New York hotel rooms are quite small compared with other parts of USA. The room was clean and had most things you would need. Bathroom again was small but had all we needed. The hotel did not have many public areas but had a library with internet access. Free coffee in the morning and hot apple cider for later in the day was available in the small foyer. On finding out it was my wifes birthday, just after arrival a birthday card and a plate of choclate covered strawberries arrived at our room ( a nice touch). What makes this hotel special though is its position. It is perfect to walk to a lot of the major tourist spots and close to the subway system for going further afield. Another major plus for this hotel is the friendly and helpful staff especially the concierge for whom nothing seemed to much trouble.
