I stayed there on 2 occasions in July and August and it is as wonderful as previous times I have stayed there
My arrival was very late around 11
00pm and when enterting my room the lights were on
soft music playing
bed turned back and slippers waiting
What more could you want at that time of the night
It was like coming home
Staff there are always wonderful
many have been there for years
The location of this Hotel is fabulous
so close to Times Square and great shopping on 5th Ave
was also within walking distance to some of my bsiness appointments and an easy walk to Penn Station to catch the train for further appointments
Highly recommend this Hotel too for ladies travelling on their own as always feel very safe here
