I recently stayed here at the Iroquois for the first time
My husband and I usually stay in the larger properties in NYC but wanted to stay in midtown but find something smaller and more boutique
ish in style
After looking at my trusted trip advisor for ideas
we gave this one a shot
The positives are many
location is excellent and how many times can I say how wonderful it was to be right next to db Bistro Moderne
it was like having Daniel Boulud for room service
We were attending the Jay Z/Kanye show at MGM and it was fantastic being so close to the Garden
We encountered an overall quality of service and friendliness at the hotel that would make this a return destination for us
Comfy bed
GREAT shower
always important to me and this one was perfect
On the down side
the rooms are VERY small so if you need workspace this might not be the one for you
The "desk" was a glorified nightstand crammed right next to the bed but we made it work and how much time do you really spend in the room in this amazing city anyway?
Biggest faux pas was probably upon check in when the nice young man who helped us was getting a bottle of wine sent up to the room which never showed up
and with the larger Sofitel next door
they struggle a bit with the cab situation
Really not much to say except this is a great little hotel with a good staff
a comfy bed
awesome shower and a great location
really all you need here in NY
Enjoy
