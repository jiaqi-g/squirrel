We stayed here for our 5th wedding anniversary
The hotel itself is very well maintained
the rooms was clean and comfortable and a very good size especially for New York
The location is close to all the "action" without being in the middle of all the chaos
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the concierge
sent a bottle of wine to our room when he found out it was our anniversary
