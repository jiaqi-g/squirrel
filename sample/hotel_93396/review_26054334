Let's start with the fact that I am something of a hotel snob
The high points
very comfortable bed (lots of pillows
high thread count sheets)
very clean
excellent and polite service (doorman to front desk to room attendant)
legitimate fitness facility (dumbbells
weight machines
sauna
cardio choices)
superb intimate bar and restaurant
The nominal knocks
small lobby which was bit cluttered
small bathroom (but very clean
good pressure
excellent products
plenty of great towels and two fluffy robes)
slow elevators (but zero noise at night
smallish room
I'm joining their Gold Guest Advantage program and coming back soon
I stay in the City often (25 nights plus/year) and this hotel is my new favorite
Stayed two nights
and it felt like home immediately
