By New York hotel standards this one is a gem
Very clean rooms
with a professional staff ready to assist you with any requests
Bathrooms are updated and they take the time to orient you to hotel
The reports are correct that the thermostat on the wall really doesn't work like a normal thermostat
and apparently the hotel has heard the critic and make it a point to explain how to adjust the temperature in the room
We were lucky to have a room with a window air conditioner so our experience was fine
Our only regret was that we didn't have enough time to try the restaurant but with so many choices within in walking distance we didn't mind
It is a nice sized boutique hotel you can't go wrong with
