The concierge at the IROQUOIS was extremely helpful. We were 4 girls spending a weekend shopping, eating and theatre. He gave us instructions on using the subway system to go to Ground Zero and Little Italy...very simple! The location was perfect, we were minutes from Times Square and Fifth Ave. The hotel rooms are small, but very clean. Bathrooms were spotless. The hotel bar was also a nice stop for a drink and nibbles between shopping and seeing sights. Definitely would go back
