Awesome and delightful stay at this hotel
Good room
clean and comfortable
Close to many activities
Very relaxing
due to staff and accomadations
felt like we were going home each night
Good breakfast in their resturant with friendly and attentive staff
TV/DVD player great with movies to check out at the front desk for free
Normal pay for view movies were also available
This was a family trip (we came with older teenagers) but I would rate this hotel very high whether I was coming to NYC for business or leisure
If you have a question
ask the staff
they will help
Excellent fitness room for a smaller hotel
