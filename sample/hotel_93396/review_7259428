I planned on a one
night stay for business but ended up staying for four because the ice
storm cancelled my flight
What started as a disaster ended up being a pleasant weekend in NYC
largely due to the quality and service at this hotel
Knowing that I was going to pay $300+ for any decent room in midtown I wanted to try something new and perhaps better than the usual W
Hyatt
Waldorf and other hotels in the 300
400 range
Based on reviews here on Trip Advisor I decided to take a chance
I was not dissapointed
The reviews are quite accurate
Excellent for adults looking for a quiet yet conveniently located hotel
The rooms (I had two similar ones) are spacious by NYC standards with a chair+ottoman
full size dresser and smallish desk with chair
laid out
Bathroom amenities (Molton Brown
my favorite) and fixtures (compact Ritz Carlton style) were superb
Plasma TV
windows that actually open
frette linens
comfortable bed (almost Ritz
Only thing missing is a coffee maker; I hope someone from the Iroquois is reading this
Staff was quite accommodating to all of us stranded travelers
They kept the same rate through the weekend despite typically higher charges
They had the uncommon ability to know when to help and when to leave you alone
I especially like the hot cider at the front desk in the evening
it took the bite out of the ice storm
Loved the library off the lobby
perfect antidote for small NYC rooms
I spent the weekend watching the St
Patty's parade (started in front of the hotel) and shopping
It is convenient to the men's stores on Madison
Didn't get a show in but this is a perfect close yet quiet location
I will never stay at another NYC hotel again
This is my new home away from home
