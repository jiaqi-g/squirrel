I chose this hotel for my first weekend in Manhatten for my wife's birthday. I had read the
previous reviews, especially from those who go back for additional visits. Count me now as one of those.
The location is perfect in midtown Manhatten, just two blocks from Times Square, and within six blocks of most theatres, many fine restaurants, including its own Triomphe, and shopping.
It is a small boutique type property, with all the amenities one needs for a quiet, restful
stay. Excellent service, and small, but very comfortble, well appointed rooms.
The Triomphe restaurant was an unexpected surprise, and we had a delicious six-course tasting menu served at our table in the bar, where the atmosphere was more 
casual.
