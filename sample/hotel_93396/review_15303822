We stayed last friday (April 18
20) through the weekend with the express intention of seeing midtown manhatten
shops
museums
theatre
The iroquois is in a prime location for all our tourist requirements
We turned up at midnight and as well as several staff on the front desk
we were expected and welcomed
The room was a standard room and spacious enough for two people not to be falling over each other and their luggage
Where in central manhatten can you get a reasonably priced large room ? ;
)
Bottom line
weary after a day wandering around NY the room was all it should be; clean
enthusiastic air con ;
potent hot shower
enough fluffy towels and robes and a comfortable bed
We checked into The Empire on W63 on monday night and sorely regretted not still being in the Iroquois (unfortunately someone else booked the empire for us)
