We stayed at the Iroguois the weekend just before "Sandy
" Great location (near but not on top of Times Square)
nicely appointed room
free wifi
friendly and helpful staff
The Triumph restaurant in the hotel is quite good
The bar is pricey but comfortable to hang out in
We reserved the hotel for 3 nights
but by Sunday afternoon it was clear that NYC was shutting down and we should head for home
At 1:15 pm
we told the front desk that we might like to leave
(Our room had already been made up for us
) The hotel was extremely accommodating
just asked us to be out soon
which was fine
and did not charge us for the night
This hotel is a great find
