When staying in the city you can't pass up a chance to stay right in mid town at the Iroqouis
The small boutique hotel with its quirky but wonderful rooms will make you feel like a king
Little expense was spared in the room comfort
It is NYC so don't expect a large square room
The rooms are fitted into a small foot print
We prefer back rooms in the city
They tend to reduce street noise as well as the early morning trash pickup that takes place around the city
The Iroquois is a short block from Time Square
You are within walking distance to all the broadway shows and being the hotel is mid town you are central to all locations in the city
The restaurant is a great place to eat if you don't want to go out but remember you are in the city so go be adventurous
We have stayed at the Iroquois many times and would not consider and other hotel
