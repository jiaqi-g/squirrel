We visit New York at least once a year and sometimes twice. We have stayed at a different property every time. We have always been from a little to a lot disappointed. Not this time. From the moment of our arrival to the time of departure we could not ask for more. Pleasant helpful staff that really made you feelat home. Well appointed room and bath Top notch onsite restaurant and fitness center. We did not see a refrigerator in the room and mentioned it to the Bellman. In minutes one was delivered to our room at no charge. Great central location. Nice street with hotels and private clubs. We parked the car and walked everywhere we wanted to go. We were at the cozy bar on our last night and I guess Nina summed it up by saying,"I think we found our spot in New York"; A little Gem in The Big Apple!
