We were in town for the NYC Marathon and sightseeing, so location was important. From the Iroquois, we walked everywhere, from midtown to downtown and into Brooklyn. Times Square, Central Park, and many other of the "must see" amenities were a short walk away.
The hotel was well-presented - clean, organized, and well decorated. We like the boutique-type hotel, versus the "bigger is better" motife and some of the big brands. The room was small, but had everything we needed; on top of that, we really didn't spend much time there, so it wasn't TOO small. The room was cute and there were no dings or dents to anything inside.
The bathroom was clean, which is critical for both of us.
Lastly, we were very happy with the service at the hotel. The doormen, bellboys, and concierge were especially friendly. They repeatedly asked about our trip, how the marathon went, etc...questions that showed they remembered previous conversations, which made the experience that much more personal. I wish I had caught the names of the bellman and the one concierge in general, as they definitely lifted the experience to another level for us.
The concierge - a very nice, soft-spoken gentleman with brown hair, fielded a number of inquiries from my wife and was extremely thorough in his answers and assistance. We sort of looked forward to running into a couple of the guys each day.
The few times we ran into the housekeeping and maintenance staff in the halls, they
We didn't use the workout room for working out, but we did go there a time or two each day to fill our water bottles (there is a filtered water station there).
In all, we were very pleased with our experience at the Iroquois and would recommend it to anyone.
