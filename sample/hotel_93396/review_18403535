My husband and I recently stayed here one night while in NYC
The hotel was well kept
clean
spacious room
It's considered a small luxury hotel
The staff were friendly
and offered ideas for restaurants
The location is great
walking distance to Times Square
Empire State Building
Cabs were very easy to get outside to go to other areas of the city
The only downside
and it didn't affect us at all
is they are currently renovating the lobby
I would stay here again and recommend this hotel to everyone
