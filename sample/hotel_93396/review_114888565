This hotel is small
but that's what makes it so wonderful
The staff are very helpful and attentive
We asked the front desk to get us a reservation at the very well known becco
and somehow they got it for us for the same night
All of the staff are very friendly and always smiling
The rooms are immaculate and well designed with very chic decor
They also offer a complimentary turndown service every night with chocolates and a weather card
The lobby is a peaceful haven from the big city with a small library with complimentary computer use
The doormen are also very friendly and helpful by offering to hail taxis or give u directions to your own form of transportation
One doormen was so helpful(can't remember his name) he sat down and had a short conversation with us about how to get to Penn station and the best and worst times to come back to NYC
Overall this is a real gem and we can't wait to come back
