We stayed at the Iroquois over Memorial Day weekend
and absolutely loved it
Other reviews provide details about room size
furnishings
and convenient location
so no need to rehash those here
other than to say that this hotel is everything we've come to expect from a Small Luxury Hotel property
We sat in the Triomphe bar and had drinks one evening
and decided to order dessert after coveting the lemon meringue pie of the gentleman sitting next to us
He asked us how we were enjoying the hotel
whether the concierge had been helpful
whether we'd tried the restaurant and how we liked it
; it turned out he was the manager of the property
He seemed genuinely interested in our feedback
which was all positive
and particularly proud of the fact that many of the staff had been with the hotel for a number of years
When we got back to our room later that evening
he'd sent us up a bottle of wine
This is a hotel that takes pride in providing excellent service
and it shows
