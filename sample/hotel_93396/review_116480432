we stay for 3 nights and was asked to upgrade the room. it was a great and quiet room. (king size bed). the staff was amazing and very welcoming and helpful. the male conceirge was excellent. we had our flight cancelled and called the hotel back and they were more than accomodating. thanks for a great stay. we will definitely stay again.
