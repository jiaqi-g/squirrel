Praise from Switzerland
We have recently returned from another of our very pleasant stays at the Iroquois. The hotel seems to have an on-going programme of small improvements which in toto make rooms and the breakfast even more attractive. We continue to feel that at least one of the hotel's major assets is the quality of its personnel. Everybody you encounter seems to want to help and does - a particular salute those behind the reception desk. Have already made reservations for another visit a few months from now to which we look forward.
