My friends and I got together in the city for a wonderful weekend and the Iroquois helped to make it so special. The rooms were beautiful, clean and quiet. The staff was extremely attentive and willing to help us with ANYTHING we needed!! The treatment we received was wonderful. The food was WELL above average--TOP NOTCH!! We actually had wished we stayed there for dinner!! We had a BLAST at the bar--visiting and being treated like we were their only guests! I truly have to say that my experience at this hotel was a 10 all the way!! When I go back this will be the first and only place I will call. It is our new tradition...Can't wait to go back!!
Many thanks to Scott and Alex!!!
