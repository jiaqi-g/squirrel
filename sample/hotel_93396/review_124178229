The Iroquois hotel was amazing, i loved the location just 2 blocks off times square on a quiet side street. The subways are very close, and if you seeing a broadway show most of the theaters are on the same block or very close by. the staff was excellent i actually got there super early 7:00 a.m due to a red eye flight and they had my room waiting, that was totally unexpected. there is a great bar and restaurant in the hotel, as well as many chain restaurants in the neighborhood. This is the hotel to go too if you want to be near the action but still be able to close your door and leave it behind when you want to relax.
