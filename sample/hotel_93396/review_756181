This hotel was recommended to us by friends, and they were right! The Old-World Elegance of this classy hotel was just what we wanted for our romantic getaway! The beds were comfortable, and the rooms were amazingly upscale for the price we paid. We got to visit Broadway and Fifth Avenue, and when we returned to our suite's living room, we felt like we were in a fine Paris hotel...we will very likely return again for an encore of our own "Autumn in New York."
