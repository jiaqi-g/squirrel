From the moment we enter the Iroquois we felt at home. The room had
two full size beds that were extremely comfortable, TV, a chest of drawers, a desk , internet accessability and an immaculate bathroom which had plenty of tolietries and washcloths/towels that were big and soft. They even provided robes to use. The view was nothing to look at but after a long day
running around NYC the view was not important. The room was warm, 
cosy and comfortable. Each night we tried to watch TV at the end of our
day, but fell asleep soon after we had gotten into bed. The staff was 
extremely helpful and kind. We couldn't have asked for better. My friend
and I congratulated ourselves for finding this gem of a hotel. We will certainly stay at the Iroquois Hotel the next time we are in New York.
