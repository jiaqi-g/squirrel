This was our third trip to NY in 2 years
This time to see Springsteen in Madison Square Gardens
The Iroquois is in a brilliant location for all the main mid town attractions
The bar is very good and the rooms well kept
I know it's New York
a boutique hotel and rooms are generally small
These rooms are tiny
we sayed at Sofitel and Crowne Plaza before and these rooms seem much
much smaller than those
There was a mini heat wave when we were there (went to the meadowlands for Football in T shirts) and the AC is not great
I liked it but would go back to the Sofitel in preference
