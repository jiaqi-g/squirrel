This lovely hotel is perfectly situated for broadway plays
sight
seeing and shopping
My granddaughter and I could walk to all attractions
The staff was courteous and the doorman was attentive
but our room did need some basic maintenance
Two lights were burned out; the bathroom sink drain didn't work
the door lock was difficult
However
the staff courteously dealt with each matter
Housekeeping failed to come one day
but did a fine job the rest of the time
I had expected a 5 star hotel and so I was a little disappointed
but I'd still recommend it because you can't beat the location and it was comfortable
