Our whole experience at this hotel was a disaster
We checked in after a long flight and wanted to get changed
Unfortunately our room was not ready
We never got to rest/freshen up
We had to leave and come back in an hour
When we returned we finally got to see our rooms
There was nothing special about the rooms
It was tiny
It only consisted of a bed
tv (although it was a nice flat screen
half the time the channels wouldn't change/hear them)
and a bathroom
The beds were pretty comfy though
The desk/concierge wasn't too friendly
Every time we asked for help/info it always seemed like a hassel
I never felt comfortable
We got an ajoining room with an outer door
That way we could keep our doors open and close the outer door
the outer door locks and there is no way to open it
We realized it and asked the maid to please ask the desk to open the door
We returned about 4 hours later to find a locked door
So we went down to ask the desk and they said they would send the engineer up to open it
Why don't they just have a key??? GOSH
Well we waited
and then waited some more for the engineer
It took about an hour until we could finnaly get into our room
Anways
Overall this hotel was a nightmare
It was clean and pretty but it had too many errors
There are tons of other hotels in NYC so go try them instead of The Iroquois
