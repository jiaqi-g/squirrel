My friend and I had booked deluxe rooms for our weekend stay
We arrived at 12 noon
too early to get into the rooms but the staff were very helpful; took our bags
gave us help with restaurant bookings
We came back at around 5
were given room keys
and told the luggage would be sent straight up
The luggage took nearly 15 minutes to arrive and in fact I was on my way to get it when it arrived at the 3rd floor
I should have just taken it up myself
I then unpacked the things that I needed for 2 days
got into my bathrobe and went to have a shower
only to discover that there was no water
I phoned down to reception to be told how the shower worked
On trying again I then had to phone once again
as there really was no water
Someone was sent up
maybe 10 minutes later
but not a member of the front desk staff
some poor chap who couldn't fix the water and simply had to report back to reception
I phoned AGAIN as I still hadn't heard anything
The man came back with a new room key
but it was unclear as to whether this was my new room or somewhere to have a shower
He said he would move my stuff
but I was still in my bathrobe
due to go out in half an hour
and needed my stuff
So I ended up piling it all into a heap and moving it right then
On getting downstairs to reception I imparted my feelings and
of course
the staff were very apologetic
But my 'rest' time had been wrecked
and I just felt that the whole point of booking into a hotel like this was to avoid exactly this kind of problem
When I got back to my room there was a letter of apology and wine and chocolates
and an invitation to breakfast
which was a very nice gesture
but I'd have rather not have had the hassle
Good things
the bar in Triomphe was lovely
and the Lanterns Keep bar is really special
The location is fantastic
The staff are friendly and polite
Not so good
only one lift working
the wi
fi is a bit touch and go
and the rooms were comfortable (especially the bed)
but very slightly shabby
The paintwork could do with renewing
and both the rooms I saw were very dark
There was no vanity mirror in the room I was moved to
I am aware that I sound extremely fussy
but I'm really not
I often stay in travelodges or similar and am very happy with it
but having splashed out to stay somewhere really speacial
I expected more for the money
I've stayed at 2 other hotels in the 'small luxury' range recently and they were both better experiences
I'm sure that the Iroquois experience can be fantastic
but unfortunately it wasn't for me
on this occasion
