Just returned from 4 nights in New York, staying at the Iroquois.
On arrival we were greeted by a very friendly bellman, who helped us with our bags and had a very straight forward check in.
The bellman showed us to our room (a deluxe king on the 6th floor) and gave us a run down of how to use a few amenities - the shower, TV, ipod dock how to use the DVD rental service etc. Whilst the room is small (as noted on other reviews), it was absolutely beautifully decorated and did not lack a single thing. The bed was extremely comfortable, we had numerous towels, lovely molten brown toiletries and the complementary bottle of water was a lovely touch. The closet is big enough to store cases in, so don't worry about being short of space. The room was maintained beautifully during our stay both during the day and also in the evening turn down service.
In the hotel itself, you can use the complementary internet and printing facilities (very handy for last minute trip research and return flight on-line check in) and free coffee is provided in the morning, with iced-water provided in the afternoon (very welcome in the August heat).
The friendliness from the staff continued throughout our stay - from hello/goodnight's from reception, to information from the concierge and bellman which made us feel right at home.
The location of the hotel is superb, a couple of blocks from times square in one direction and grand central station in the other, which left us free to visit a number of the main sites very easily from our hotel.
I would wholeheartedly recommend the Iroquois without hesitation for anyone visiting New York, and it will be top of my list when booking a return trip.
