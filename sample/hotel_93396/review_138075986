The hotel is lovely and the staffs are very helpful. The hotel is well located at the heart of Manhattan. It is a great value in this area of town, close to Times Square and Grand Central. The room is well equipped and the bed is comfortable. There is no coffee maker in the room but Gregorys Coffee shop is just down the road for coffee and muffins. 
I couldnâ€™t connect to the internet on the first night. The front desk staff came in to my room and tried to help me, she had the internet server to call me but the problem was still. I knew it was nothing they could do but at least she called me back and asked if it worked. I really appreciated that. It was actually my computer firewall problem, after I fixed it, the internet worked fine. 
The staffs friendless are wonderful, especially the one who helped me with the internet, and the doorman who hailed taxi for me all the time. Absolutely much much better than some staffs in anyother hotels I have stayed, just say hello in the way everyone would expect, or may have conversation with you, but then completely forget anything about you next time they see you. 
In The Iroquois, I am recognized and my requests are being taken care right away. Highly recommend to my colleagues and friends.
