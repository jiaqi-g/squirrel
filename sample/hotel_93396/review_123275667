My wife and I stayed at the Iroquois when we were running the NYC marathon in early Nov 2011. What wonderful accomodations! The rooms were clean, comfortable and full of character with modern amenities. No cookie cutter rooms here! The comfortable beds enabled us to get a great night's sleep before the marathon. The staff was amazingly helpful with directions, questions and were extremely accomodating in helping us with our luggage and also storing it so we could pick it up after the race. The restaurant had a wonderful romantic and atmosphere and the food was delicious. We will definitely stay here again for a romantic couples getaway into the city.
