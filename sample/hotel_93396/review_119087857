I took my Mom to this hotel for her 63rd birthday (it was both of our 1st trips to NYC) and after staying in 5
star hotels all over the world
I can honestly say that this is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at
1) I called when our flight landed at 10:30am and asked if we could have an early check
in and they said they will work on it
When we arrived
our room was ready
so nice
2) Vanessa
the concierge
is amazing
Very friendly and patient and she gave us some great tips to get around NYC for our first visit
3) All of the doormen were extremely friendly and accommodating
We really appreciated when they let us borrow umbrella's on a rainy day
The complimentary coffee in the lobby was also delicious
Thank you for a great visit
keep up the good work
