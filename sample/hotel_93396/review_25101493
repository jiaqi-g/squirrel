I LOVE THIS HOTEL. Room size for Manhattan was generous, staff were very helpful and accomodating, the hot cider at the front desk was very welcome after a walk in the blowing snow, and the restaurant/bar were a welcome retreat. Absolutely perfectly located within walking distance to all the Broadway theatres, 5th ave. shopping, NYC library, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Times Square. I specifically wanted to visit the Algonquin (two doors down and over my price range) to drink a martini in the lobby bar to Dorothy Parker, eat a couple of great meals, see two Broadway productions, and wander 5th and 9th avenues for shopping/deli food respectively, and it was perfectly located. Fly to Newark, take the Liberty shuttle (every 15-30 minutes) to midtown, walk 2.5 blocks to the hotel....perfect. This is the only place I will consider staying again in midtown.
