The "Date Night" package was awesome
It included cocktails in the very cool Lantern's Keep bar and continental breakfast delivered to our room
The room was fairly small
but very comfortable and quiet
We were celebrating an anniversary
and the hotel sent up a bottle of wine
some chocoates and a note
Great location in Midtown
Only complaint is that the bathroom was small
and there was not much room for personal toiletries
If you're driving into the city
the hotel has a great rate at the parking garage directly across the street
The staff was all very professional and friendly
Would definitely stay at the Iroquois again
