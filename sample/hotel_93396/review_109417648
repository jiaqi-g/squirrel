Good hotel which is very close to times square
excellent for shopping and other
The rooms are clean
the service is good
Free dvd's to watch when you are bored
However i must say that the sound of airco at nights is very very annoying
It is like you are traveling with an airplane
Avoid the 12th floor if you care about WIFI
We got a room on 12th and wifi was not working
however we got another room on 9th immediatly so all taken care of
