My husband and I just checked out of the Iroquois. The location is great and very near Times Square and all the shows. We had our theater tickets delivered to the hotel on check in and that was really terrific. The room was small and we didn't have any view at all ... looked at a brick wall. But, the room was very, very quiet which we thought of as positive. We did have a negative experience when asking for additional towels (had to ask twice), and pillows (three times). Internet wireless being "free" ... is a positive, too.
