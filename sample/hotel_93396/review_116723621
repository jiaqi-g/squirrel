The Iroquois hotel is a small boutique hotel that is ideally situated in midtown Manhattan, close to Times Square, Grand Central etc. Rooms are small but very comfortable and clean and traffic noise was not an issue. 
The staff is very approachable and helpful and I would like to commend both Alan and Vanessa, the two concierges on duty, for their assistance and help in planning daily excursions and flight departures.
