My stay at this hotel is a great example of how the reviews from this site are very helpful in vacation planning. 
After reading many satisfied reviews for this property and seeing their competitive rates for my President's Day weekend to NYC, I booked with the Iroquois.
I took the advice of several reviewers and joined the hotel's "Gold Guest" program prior to my arrival. After joining, I received a couple of friendly messages from the Iroquois staff, welcoming me to the program and asking me some preferences for my room and tastes. 
After checking in, all those preferences were granted. I was on an upper level floor, there were chocolate truffles, sparkling water & a bottle of red wine, all compliments of the hotel. It was a great start to my stay. Additionally, the staff at the front desk upgraded my basic room to a deluxe queen compliments of the hotel. Whatever their reason for the free upgrade, I appreciated the gesture and I thank tripadvisor reviewers for their advice.
What most comes to mind when thinking of the Iroquois is the value. Along with the welcome gifts, you get free wireless internet in your room. There is a business center (library) that allows you to use their computers and printers free of charge. You get a daily newspaper... even the Sunday NY Times, free. Plus, the little things like the morning coffee in the lobby and hotel apple cider in the evening... and the milk chocolate on the pillows they do at evening turn-down. These gestures by the hotel greatly enhanced my stay and, in my opinion, made the Iroquois the best value in town... Like no other I have experienced in NYC.
I compliment the Iroquois management on the way they run their hotel. It was a pleasure to stay there and I surely will return for future visits.
