The Iroquois benefits from pleasant rooms and comfortable beds, helpful staff and many complimentary services. My family and I had a very nice stay and found that we were very spoiled to have had such a great deal on such a pleasant hotel. We also checked thouroughly for bed bugs but found no evidence of them. Highly recommended!
