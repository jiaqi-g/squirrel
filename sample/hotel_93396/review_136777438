I have stayed at other boutique hotels in New York and thoroughly enjoyed them
This hotel I did not
Please remember though that some events happened while we were there
It does not mean it happens constantly
Pros
Great location between Times Square and 5th ave
Comfortable beds
Very clean
Older style but updated nicely
Awesome for a romantic getaway or for a solo traveler
Cons
Very dark in lobby
not welcoming
Bellhop not available to open doors for people? Wonderful guys but never around to help
We happened to be coming back to the hotel and had to help arriving guests with large luggage up the stairs on three seperate occasions
I understand it was very hot outside
but when we would walk by other boutique hotels
bellhops were outside sweating it out
FYI there are stairs to get into the front door
not many but enough when hauling luggage
Because the building is older and it was in the 90s during our stay
our home was very warm and we had it turned down all the way
Sorry
I like it really cool when I do come back to rest especially when you have been walking
shopping and sweating all day
Rooms are tiny and yes I know that is the standard for New York BUT if you have a party of 4 and are not reserving a suite than you need to look at other hotels
I have stayed at plenty others that have much larger rooms
Because it is a boutique hotel and very small
I guess I thought we would be greeted when we would walk in or leave
The bellhop would greet us as he was standing by the front desk half the time instead of the door
:)
For me
I just didn't get the exciting fun feel of New York as I have other times
If you like it quiet
dark and quaint then this is perfect for you
