The Iroquois is one of the few hotels we were able to find that would allow smoking in the room
along with the location of the hotel
was the reason we booked this hotel
The price of the room is a little more than we typically spend but it was worth it
The rooms are small and our room didn't offer a view
but that was expected given the hotel is located amidst high rise buildings
Luxurious and unbelievably comfortable bed
robes and towels
Lovely amenities
including the complimentary bottle of wine and chocolate truffles left for us the first evening
Each additional evening add'l chocolates were left with turn down service
Staff very friendly
Doorman always there
Concierge service helpful but my only advice would be that the girl in concierge should want to help and offer suggestions to travelers in NYC but I felt as though I was an annoyance and a bother (didn't care though
she was getting paid to do a job)
The maps were very helpful and gave good suggestions how to navigate the city
Superb trip
superb city
oh so much to do
I will return
dts and dvd
