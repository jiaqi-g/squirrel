Spent several nights at the Iroquois last spring and we had a wonderful experience
Loved the location
the rooms and the hotel but most especially the concierge we dealt with there
He was warm
friendly and welcoming and assisted us several times with making restaurant bookings and hockey tickets
He was extremely knowledgeable and spent a lot of time with us
His suggestions were excellent
We are going again to New York again in March and will be staying in the same hotel
