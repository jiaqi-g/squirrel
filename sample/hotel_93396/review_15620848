My friend and I decided to spend a weekend in New York, and we booked rooms at the Iroquois because they were relatively well-priced and very well located for our theatre excursions. We were not disappointed. The rooms were well appointed, clean and comfortable. The manager himself asked to make sure we had everything we needed and to see if he could be of help. The front desk staff and the concierge were all very helpful with directions and reservations, and the breakfast buffet was a very good value. We would both definitely return.
