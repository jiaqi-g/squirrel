Nice boutique hotel in Midtown
Smallish rooms but that is what you expect in Manhattan
The rooms are very comfortable and the bedding was lovely and crisp
All in all a great place to stay in NY
The only down sides worth commenting on are the room service menu is rather limited but there is a diner next door that delivers
And the German receptionist is not the friendliest person that I have ever come across but the rest of the staff make up for her shortcomings
