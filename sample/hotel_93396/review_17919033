The Iroquois was a delight on all fronts
newly redecorated rooms; extremely convenient to the theater district; charming
helpful staff; outstanding restaurant
Plus a cozy library for gathering
reading
and online research
It's two doors away from the historic Algonquin
with lots of good restaurants close by
We especially liked the flexible and friendly staff
Can hardly wait to return
