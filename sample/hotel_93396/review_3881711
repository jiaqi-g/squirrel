Our experience at the Iroquois was a positive one. We were only in town for one night (9/2) to visit a relative and see a show, so our interaction with the staff was limited. We did arrive early, however, and they were very friendly. We were offered a room immediately, but were forewarned that it was on a smoking floor. We passed on the offer, checked our bag, and came back a few hours later to a great room. It wasn't huge, and it didn't have a view (fire escape/alley), but it was clean and quiet (we have four-year old twins so silence is a valuable commodity!) and the bed felt sumptuous. The bathroom was clean and the robe kicked you-know-what. Yes, the elevator is small, but it got me to where I needed to go. And the staff at the front desk gave us the heads up on which elevator was fastest, so that was cool.
Only complaint: our room was FREEZING. I guess I could have complained, but I adjusted the thermostat per the instructions provided and dove under that huge comforter instead.
