We arrived at the hotel at one in the morning after a flight from Europe and are first impressions were of just how brown and unboutique like the hotel was
We had a std room which was small but once you got past the brownness of it
which I think automatically makes it look shabby
was very clean
we'll laid out and with a very comfortable bed
We were ther three nights and by the end
the room we found the room ok
The big selling points for us were the location
which couldn't be better plus free wifi and that it was clean and quiet
We were with a couple in a superior room that seemed less brown probably because it was bigger and therefore less overpowering
Fair value for money
although might stay next door at the Sofitel if I got a good deal when we go back
Staff very friendly and helpful
