Stayed at this hotel as part of a weekend cyberpackage by Northwest Airlines. The staff at the Iroquois worked exceptionally hard to please--from the bellman to the concierge to the front desk staff. As a member of the Small Luxury Hotels' club, I was upgraded to a view room; they were very nice when I asked to be moved to the back of the hotel instead (no view, but very quiet). They delivered wine and fruit to our room with a note congratulating us on our anniversary. The concierge gave us great resto suggestions. The bellman got us a car service (cheaper than a cab) to Newark airport. Super helpful, all.
