If you are headed to NYC
you would do well to consider a stay at The Iroquois
a boutique hotel well
located in midtown
We stayed at The Iroquois for Labour Day weekend when we were in the city to watch US Open Tennis and shop; the hotel had been recommended to us by friends who have stayed there twice before and had us sold when they told us about the Frette linens and bathrobes
Molton Brown products
convenient location (easy walk to the bustle of Times Square (where we had stayed before
W 44th St bn 5th & 6th is a much more civilized location)
Grand Central Station
Lord & Taylor
Bryant Park
etc) and stellar service (Vanessa at the concierge desk was uber
helpful with restaurant reservations
directions and questions in relation to our pre
planning)
We had a lovely room which was super comfy and spacious for midtown
I am a fan and am telling friends and family that The Iroquois is the place to stay in New York City
