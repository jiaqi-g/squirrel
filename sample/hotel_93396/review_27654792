We spent three nights at the Iroquois in April
myself
our teenage daughter and my husband
We chose a suite
and in effect found it was two rooms for the price of one
Our daughter could shut the door and have her own space
and a very comfortable bed
The hotel is brilliantly located
an easy walk to the theatre district
Times Square
Empire State Building
Fifth Avenue
and of course good shopping
At the same time
when you walk inside
it feels like an oasis
The door is opened for you with a smile
and it's quiet and comfortable inside
The desk staff greet you with a steaming cup of cider
very refreshing
The room was spacious
immaculately clean
and nicely furnished
Each evening your bed is turned down
and chocolates and a weather report left on your pillow
If I could change one thing
I'd have windows that can open
but that would allow noise
so it might not suit some
the double glazing meant it was very quiet
There was also one waitress who disappointed with her cool attitude
However
the rest of the staff were terrific
and that's what really makes the place
Absolutely everyone else
from cleaners
doormen and most of all the desk staff
were ready and willing to help
and generously sorted out any problem
For example
we were offered umbrellas on rainy days
and were allowed to shower and warm up after a drenching on the last day of our stay
long after we should have checked out of the room
and for a very reasonable extra fee
Really
the staff make the place what it is
a perfect spot for wonderful holiday
