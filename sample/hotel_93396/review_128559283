Three adult women were traveling to NY to celebrate retirement. We looked and looked for a 4 star hotel in the theater district under $300/nt and, mainly because of Tripadvisor reviews (and price), we chose the Iroquois and we are so happy that we did. We had 3 deluxe queen rooms (corners), and all 3 of us were totally satisfied. The rooms were incredibly quiet (which is unusual for NY), and the bedding and furnishings were plush. The bathroom was large (also unusual for NY), all marble, and beautiful. Amenities included robes, luxury towel, chocolates at night, and the friendliest staff we ever experienced in NY. Without a doubt, all of us said that we would stay at this hotel again. In fact, I am booking this hotel for a return trip to NY in a few months with my husband. The onsite restaurant was nice for a drink (albeit the drinks were expensive), and the restaurant seemed full every night. We never ate there, but we had a wonderful Italian meal about 1/2 block away at Trattoria Dopo Teatro. The location of this hotel, coupled with the friendliness of the staff, the quality of the room and furnishings, the reasonable price, and the location near the theater and fine restaurants make it ideal. As far as location, it is almost next door to the Sofitel and across the street from Hotel Melea on 44th, just off 5th Avenue. We're glad we found this hidden gem.
