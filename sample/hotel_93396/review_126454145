We stayed at the Iroquois for 3 nights and it served our purposes perfectly. It's really close to everything we needed to get to, but really quiet for NYC. Loved the Frette bedding & towels! The room was sort of small, but well appointed. It was pretty warm in the room, but the windows open which helped us cool it down. Careful though, not all of the windows had screens. Didn't have a chance to try the restaurant or bar, but they looked very nice. Another nice feature is a computer with a printer in the small library off the lobby. Very convenient for printing theatre tickets and boarding passes.
