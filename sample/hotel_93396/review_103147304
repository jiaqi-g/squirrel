For the price paid, the Iroquois definitely was a pleasant surprise. Being accustomed to overpriced midtown hotels with micro-sized rooms, snotty staff and uncomfortable beds, the Iroquois was a welcomed change. The rooms were more than adequately sized - not huge, but by NYC standards, just fine. The location is perfect for business midtown. Close to Times Square (but not so close that you'll be annoyed by it) so good for tourists too. The decor of the hotel is more classic than trendy and hip, so if you value style over substance, you may be disappointed. 
Overall, I would definitely check out the Iroquois the next time I am in NYC for business or pleasure.
