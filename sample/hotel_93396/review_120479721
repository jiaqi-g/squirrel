We stayed at The Iroquois a couple of weeks ago
I absolutely loved the location
close to Times Square and Fifth Avenue shopping
Everyone was very friendly at the hotel
I especially liked the turn down service with the yummy chocolate
The concierge recommended an excellent Italian restaurant
Tony DiNapoli
The front desk even heated up our leftovers for the next night
The room was clean and nicely appointed with Molton Brown products
We got there super early and was given a room to relax and refresh in until our room was ready
The only thing is beware of the taxi drivers
The one that was hauled for our return to the airport didn't have his meter running and overcharged us
We didn't realized until we got home and looked up approximate rates to the airport
We will definitely love to return again
