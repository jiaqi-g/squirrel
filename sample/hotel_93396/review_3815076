Stayed in the Iroquois in mid August. The location is perfect! The rooms were nice, the beds were very comfortable, and the bathroom had a great shower. The room was small (normal for NYC) and when I asked for something high with a view the girl at the desk just looked at me. I was given a room on the second floor looking onto a fire escape. There isnâ€™t much of a lobby, so we spent all our spare time at the Algonquin lobby (fantastic) a couple of doors down. Having stayed at both the Algonquin and Iroquois, I will go back to the Algonquin.
