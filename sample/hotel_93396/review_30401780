I would and have recommended this hotel to a few people
I have stayed here twice and have now made it my destination for NYC visits
Location is perfect
within a 3
5 minute walk of Broadway
Times Square
Rockefeller Center
Radio City and Fifth Avenue
Tons of great restaurants around the area
but make sure to take in dinner and drinks at Triomphe
Ask for Robin
she is the best
The hotel staff was fabulous
concierge even knew where the best coffee was (The Red Flame)
and she was right
Room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom spotless
You won't be sorry
