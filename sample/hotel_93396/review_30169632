Our stay at the Iroquois got off to a rough start because--after wandering around NYC for a couple of hours, waiting for a room to be ready--we erroneously were put in a smoking room. Though staff at the front desk acknowledged the mistake, they were unable to put us in a non-smoking room that was the size we had reserved (four months earlier). So, we spent our first night at the hotel in a very small non-smoking room, then had to repack in order to be moved for the balance of our stay to the type of room we had reserved. The move did go smoothly; we left our bags in our first room and when we returned later in the day, they had been transferred to the "right" room.
That said, we have visited New York on numerous occasions, never finding--until now--a reasonably-priced (by NYC standards) hotel where we cared to stay a second time. We will stay at the Iroquois again. It has been nicely rehabilitated, the rooms are attractive and comfortable (though some are quite small), the staff was friendly, and the location couldn't be better for visitors. The theater district is just a block or two to the west, Fifth Avenue shopping is a block east, and Grand Central Station is just a bit farther east. And, the legendary Algonquin Hotel--with its lobby bar and resident cat--is two doors away.
Besides initially being put in a smoking room, the only problems we noticed were that there rarely was a concierge on duty (though staff at the front desk could provide assistance) and the promised nightly turn-down service didn't actually occur nightly--and when it did occur, it was strangely early (5:30 p.m.). Housekeeping staff also left tip envelopes in the room, a practice we've not previously seen.
All in all, though, we were very happy at the Iroquois.
