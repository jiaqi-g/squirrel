I just returned from a two night stay at the Iroquois for business in the Times Square area. I picked the hotel because of the location and the good reviews on this web site, but I can't rate it nearly as high as most travelers.
The location is great, just a half block from 5th Avenue and a block and a half from Times Square. The room was clean with a comfortable bed and a flat screen TV. The staff was friendly and efficient, but that is about it for my list of positives.
I was in room 206 which was very small and very dark. I couldn't tell if it was day or night out. I had a view of a brick wall and garbage. There was a large AC generator somewhere close by that kicked on and off with a loud noise that prevented me from sleeping well. If you didn't close the bathroom door to use the toilet, you couldn't get to the toilet paper without getting up off the toilet because the room was so small. There was no coffee maker either, and for $300 to $350 a night, I want a coffee maker!
i wouldn't stay again...
