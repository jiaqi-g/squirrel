My sister and I just visited NYC for the first time
After careful research
we chose The Iroquois
I can't say enough nice things
The staff is top notch (we especially adored Marga the concierge and Bill the bell hop)
the rooms are lovely
and you can't beat the location (2 blocks from Times Square and 1 block from 5th Avenue)
We also had free internet access and there was a great little diner two doors down where we could grab breakfast
I recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to the city
Thank you Iroquois for making our trip so memorable
Can't wait to visit again
