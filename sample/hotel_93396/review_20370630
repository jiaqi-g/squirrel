Our summer stay at the Iroquois was terrific
From early check in (the valet stored our bags for the day)
to the lovely room and amenities
we were won over our first day in New York
Sure
the room was small
but we weren't there to stay in
we were exploring and shopping the city
The Iroquois was perfectly located
We could walk almost everywhere
or the doorman was always willing to jump out and hail us a cab for longer trips
There was work going on in the lobby
but it never affected us
The staff actually kept apologizing for it
but you can't improve without renovation
The staff were friendly and helpful at all hours
Our room was spotlessly clean and perfect for our needs
We felt safe and secure
a plus in any large city and away from home
We will definitely return to the Iroquois on our next visit
