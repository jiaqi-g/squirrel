I'm not really sure how this hotel ranks so high among New York hotels
Don't get me wrong
it has all the appearances of being a great hotel on the surface
but there were a number of things that surprised me
The hotel is in a great location and is well maintained
Our king room was nice
but the view wasn't that great
The staff at the Lantern's Keep were a highlight of our one night stay
All of that being said
the service leaves a lot to be desired
The check
in staff were not particularly friendly
Basically it was check
in and sign here
I don't recall even being asked if there was anything we needed
I figured it was an aberration and didn't think much of it and we went off to our room
Upon getting to our Executive King room
I was really dismayed at the lack of a view
I guessed wrongly in assuming the higher priced room would have a better view
I called down to the desk and asked if anything else was available
The person said she would check and call back
She called back and said that nothing was available and then proceeded to give me a NYC street geography lesson to justify the answer
There was no answer to my question if less expensive rooms had a better view
Is there an inverse relationship between view and room size? At least the person called back
My wife and I decide to walk downstairs and catch a cab
We walk down the front steps without being acknowledged by the doorman
who is busy staring at the sidewalk
My wife proceeds into the street to hail a cab
where I can view the doorman at Sofitel and City Club hailing cabs for their guests
Our doorman is still staring at the ground until a 20
something woman pops up and "grabs" his attention
He proceeds at this point to practically go out of his way to help them in any way he can
Meanwhile
my wife is still waiting for a cab
Finally
I go to the front desk and ask if anyone can help us with a cab
which finally gets someone's attention
Another person
not the one who ignored us
tries to hail a cab
but then he tells us that it would likely be impossible to get a cab because of the shift change (which it turns out is probable) and suggest we find alternate means of transportation
We eventually give up and take the subway
Our room was a nice room
It was an ADA
compliant room according to the sign and had grab
bars near the lavatory and the tub
The odd thing was that it had a tub that a person in a wheelchair would be unlikely to use
since it had a sliding glass door and would appear to be relatively inaccessible to a disabled person
It's just my opinion
I'm sure it's legally compliant
The deadbolt on the door would not latch
It turned when the door was open
so it appeared to be operational
However
the bolt would not move when the door was closed
It made us a little nervous
but we figured the security was good enough
Still
it was annoying for a relatively high
end hotel
The thermostats are basically for show
The building is centrally controlled
so I think the thermostat does very little than open a valve for heating or cooling and perhaps controls a fan
We were comfortable
but I can't imagine what it's like on a warm day during winter
The service issues cropped up again when we decided to check out
It was basically a repeat of the check
in process
"What's your room number?" and sign here
No question about our stay even though the other person handling check out for another guest asked repeatedly
Don't even get me started about the elevators
The sign explaining the situation with the elevators is just ridiculous
Spend the money and fix it
The current situation is annoying to the guests and must have an effect on the efficiency of the service and housekeeping staff
My wife and I were trying to come up with a common denominator for our interactions with the staff and the best we could come up with was I guess we didn't look the part of an Iroquois guest
My wife and I are very casual people when we vacation even though we are well
ranked executives in both of our firms
We dress up when we have to
but dress down at any available chance
In all three cases
it appears that the person who was more well
dressed seemed to get more attention form the staff
My advice to the staff is my money is the same color of green as others and I tend to tip very well despite my t
shirt and jeans
At least I got a free shoe shine
