I just completed another two night stay and honestly
I don't see a reason to stay anywhere else in the city
It's centrally located
always clean/friendly/quiet
I had a room on 12th floor and it was very quiet which is my preference
I don't usually care about the view so these rooms work for me
I find the rooms to be a bit bigger than standard NYC hotel rooms and if you join their frequent guest program
they leave you little treats like slippers
I really enjoy my stays at Iroquois and look forward to the next one
