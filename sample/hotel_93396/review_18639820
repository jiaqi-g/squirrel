We searched expedia for the perfect hotel while we were in New York. We looked at the reveiws and judged the Iroquois the hotel that meet our desires. We wanted a hotel close to times square yet within walking distance to as many places as possible. We liked the charm of a vintage hotel which protrayed the romance of early era. Our hopes were more than meet. The hotel is smaller, rooms are smaller than the newer Ritz but the charm and the hospitality are beyond compare. We stayed one night at the Ritz for the fireworks and were so glad to come home to the Iroquis the next day. We missed the personal touch, we missed our friends at the Iroquois. The staff had nothing of the forced friendlyness we have found at other hotels. 
The rooms were beautiful, the bed was a dream, this was the perfect place to come back to after a wonderful day of exploring New York City.
Marga Snyder was spectacular as the concierge, she researched our desires for tickets and shows, booked events and gave us information and followed up on all bookings. She also gave us information of other events that we might be interested in. We greatly appreciate her effort, she added so much to our vacation.
