I have been coming to New York for a long time and I recall when hotels like the Waldorf and Essex House offered quality rooms and service at a price that wouldn't break the bank
Few hotels in 
New York can make that claim today
The Iroquois can
Our room
though not spacious
was comfortable with adequate dresser and closet space for at least a three night stay
The furnishings were first class
The bathroom was fitted with high quality fixtures and the shower met my high standards
Service was excellent
I had some trouble getting heat and the engineer came to my room instantly
My requests to the front desk and concierge were met quickly and helpfully
On Thursday night the lounge in the hotel was a real scene
The only improvement I might suggest is that the restaurant associated with the hotel offer a more varied menu
Not every guest wants to eat a full dinner
