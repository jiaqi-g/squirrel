stayed here with my girlfriend
just returned yesterday and had to say that my hotel experience was near perfect
all the staff were excellent with a special mention to Vanessa the concierge who really looked after us with all sorts of enquiries
from pre
booking clubs/restaurants to advice on all things NYC
I am actually pretty ***** fussy
very well travelled
and visit NY a lot
so this is a major compliment to the hotel
NYC boutique hotels is all about location
service & decor
this does it pretty well ;)
