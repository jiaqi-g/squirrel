I loved EVERYTHING about this hotel! It has a great location. We walked to everything, or took the subway (right around the corner!!) or took a taxi (which the hotel would flag down for us). The hotel staff was beyond helpful, nice and professional. The room was small, but hello! You are in NYC! I guess after my Paris hotel (ekk! Size of a closet!), small does not bother me. The bathroom was glorious and I loved the bathrobes. Turn-down service was cute. They'd leave you a little note about the weather for the next day! :) The fitness room was small but very clean and well stocked with water and towels. The sauna was nice, but you had to call the front desk to turn it on. I loved it, but I wish it had gotten hotter! Boo! Overall, an amazing hotel. I want to travel back to NYC just to stay here again!
