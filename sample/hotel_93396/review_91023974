We stayed at the Iroquois for a week from the 11th December
It was lovely
A boutique style hotel
small enough to make it feel more personal but big enough to have all the necessary ammenities
It's location is also ideal
centrally located to Times Square and 5th Avenue as well as all the other main attractions and shops
It was our first time in NY and we were really pleased and relieved to find we could walk everywhere from the hotel
only catching the subway down to Battery Park to catch the boat to see the Statue of Liberty
and the subway was in walking distance too
Our room was a de lux room
as we wanted a little extra space
and it was perfect
The bed was really comfortable and we had TV
DVD player
ironing board
hair dryer etc
Lovely complimentary toiletries too
It was very clean
no complaints at all
There was a turn down service each evening with a chocolate to come back to
The staff were all really friendly and helpful and the concierge booked us a return limo back to the airport which was really useful
as the cost included all tolls
flat rate and tips
No complaints at all for cleanliness
location and friendliness
a lovely little gem of a hotel nestled right in the centre for access but enough away to make it quiet
Most of all
the hot non alcoholic apple cider that you could help yourself to on your return to the hotel was absolutley lovely
You could also have a coffee to take with you on your way out of the hotel in the morning
Both of which was a really nice touch
The apple cider is a must though
Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone
it's not one of the cheapest
but NY isn't cheap
and they're not massive rooms
but again they're not in NY anyway
Really lovely
