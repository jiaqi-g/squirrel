The first time we stayed at this hotel was the December after 9/11
They have changed quite a bit since then
but even then the hotel was lovely
I love the quaint rooms
friendly service and wonderful extras
My favorite part of the room is thebathroom
SO much Luxury
We go to NYC every year and last year couldn't stay here :*( Even though the other hotel was good
the Tudor
We like the location
luxury feeling and European feel of this hotel much more
It was wonderful to visit NYC in our favorite hotel :)
