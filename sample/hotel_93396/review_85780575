We stayed at the Iroquois and very so very impressed with the staff and the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble for them, they genuinely wanted to make our stay as comfortable and as memorable as possible, I wish a few more hotels would take a leaf out of the Iroquois book in regards to customer service. The location was perfect, we could walk everywhere and the tours that the hotel organised for us were fantastic. WeI definately will be back
