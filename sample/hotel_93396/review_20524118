Had read reviews on the Iroquois on this website but unfortunately was not as good as I had expected. Arrived to find that the lobby was under major renovations. This was not mentioned when I was doing research but after my trip, I went and checked the site and there were quite a few mentions of it. Service from concierge/front desk was efficient but not the most effusive with more information. Given this is a Small Luxury Hotel, I would have expected more. Fortunately I did not have to use their 1 computer laptop to access internet as it was often used and had a line. The room and bathroom was much tinier than I expected. Possibly this is standard NY sizing but given this price, I expected a bit more. They possibly try to make up with it with Frette sheets and nice toiletries. Think it works for women but not sure the men would appreciate it. 
Having said that, it's a good location and New York is so much more about the city rather than the hotel room one is in.
