A great little hotel in a fab location. We upgraded to a suite which was superb. The former Executive King (or whatever it was titled) was actually a very small room but New York is famed for small rooms. The beds in both rooms were amazing. Huge and comfortable. 
the Staff were very helpful and friendly but the concierge wasn't around as much as we had hoped to advise us on what do - where not to go etc...
We never ate at the hotel as it seemed pricy and set in a rather boring room. 
i doubt Iâ€™d go back as there is such a choice out there but that's not because of a bad stay... probably good if you are on a work trip and want somewhere reliable to return to.
