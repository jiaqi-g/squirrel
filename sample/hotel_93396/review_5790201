I booked this hotel having read other reviews on Tripadvisor. I wanted a clean, nicely decorated hotel with a bit of luxury in a central location. This is exactly what I got !! On arrival at the hotel we found the staff very helpful and courteous. We were shown to our room on the 6th floor and found it very clean with smart decor and a lovely bathroom. The view was not brilliant as the room was situated at the side of the hotel and overlooked the rear of another hotel. However, the quality of our room and cleanliness more than made up for the view. As for the location it couldn't have been better. We were able to walk to many of the main attractions: Grand Central station, Times Square, Broadway, Empire State, 5th Avenue shopping area with Tiffany's and Trump Tower and Macy's on 34th Street. Central Park we just got a bus to and it only took about 10 minutes.There is nothing I would say that is less than satisfactory about this hotel it was excellent in every way. 
Our only mistake was to book our trip through Travelocity. We were lucky to get there at all after all the mix ups and long overdue refund after I changed to this hotel from another, Then when we got to the airport there was a problem with the booking they made. They have no real customer service department and the one they do have is virtually impossible to contact so we will never book anything with Travelocity again (BEWARE). We will go back to this hotel but book another way.
The only other word of warning I would give is that the restaurant which you can use for breakfast up the road was not value for money to me and my partner felt the fried breakfast was deep fried and overcooked. We ate the rest of our breakfast's eleswhere, the Apple Cafe in the Empire State Building excellent value for money. I got steak and eggs for the same price as a small fry up in the other place.
