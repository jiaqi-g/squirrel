My wife and I
and a business associate and his wife
stayed at the Iroquois last weekend
Our greeting at check in
the front desk and bellstaff's obvious effort to make us welcome and get us to our rooms was professional and most appreciated
Complementary hot apple cider
the daily NY Times
an always available and knowledgable concierge and use of their computers made directions and reservations a cinch
Location is an easy
short walk for shopping (Saks
Bergdorff
the theater district
)
A Perfect Stay
