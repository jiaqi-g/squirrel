we got a special deal for march- a deluxe room for $166! unheard of for a hotel with so many stars. the location is great- two minutes walk from times square, and has a nice french breakfast place on the street towards times square which you can go to for a nice morning wakeup. the staff are very helpful, if you havn't decided on what to do in nyc before you get to nyc, don't worry- they can make phone calls and suggestions and help arrange something last minute for you to do. 
the room was clean, nicely decorated, very pretty bathroom, just very small with a view of the other side of a building. the beds are comfortable but i personally love super soft blankets to cuddle up in when i sleep, so it didn't compare to my bed and i didn't have enough room to pack any blankets- but that's above and beyond what any hotel will offer, so i am sure it will meet most peoples' sleeping needs. this is a small hotel and overall it is a very clean, fancy little place- not too ritzy or glitzy but a good place that is sure to please most people. good value. free internet in downstairs lobby.
