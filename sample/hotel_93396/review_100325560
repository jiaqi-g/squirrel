We got a special deal for March- a deluxe room for $166! Unheard of for a hotel with so many stars. The location is great- two minutes walk from Times Square, and has a nice French breakfast place on the street towards Times Square which you can go to for a nice morning wakeup. The staff are very helpful, if you havn't decided on what to do in NYC before you get to NYC, don't worry- they can make phone calls and suggestions and help arrange something last minute for you to do. 
The room was clean, nicely decorated, very pretty bathroom, just very small with a view of the other side of a building. The beds are comfortable but I personally love super soft blankets to cuddle up in when I sleep, so it didn't compare to my bed and I didn't have enough room to pack any blankets- but that's above and beyond what any hotel will offer, so I am sure it will meet most peoples' sleeping needs. This is a small hotel and overall it is a very clean, fancy little place- not too ritzy or glitzy but a good place that is sure to please most people. Good value. Free internet in downstairs lobby.
