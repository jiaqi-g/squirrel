We just came back from a 5 day/4 night stay st The Iroquois
We loved it
The suite we stayed in was lovely
;plenty large for my husband
myself and our two
" twenty
something" daughters
It was just perfect for all of us
The concierge was very helpful and all the staff were helpful and pleasant
My only negative comment is regarding the restaurant
Triomphe
Specifically
parts of the beef tenderloin I ordered were so tough that I couldn't cut through them
For the first time in my life
I complained and was surprised that there was no effort at all to address my complaint
disappointing for such a highly acclaimed restaurant
Nevertheless we enjoyed our stay at The Iroquois greatly and will stay there again if we have the opportunity
