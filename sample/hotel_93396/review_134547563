Was very pleased with our stay at the Iroquois. Wanted the charm of a small hotel and this was it. Gave it a very good and not excellent because our deluxe room was very small. The staff couldn't have been nicer. It was our anniversary and they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine. Location was excellent too since we were going to see Cirque du Soleil Zarkana at Radio City. All in all a very pleasant experience.
