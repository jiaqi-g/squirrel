We stayed in an executive king room during our stay at the Iroquois last spring
Beautiful room in great condition
For NYC hotels
it was a decent size and good value
Our bathroom was a good size as well
The room was on the street side which gave good light
but a lot of traffic noise (especially on garbage pickup night
) But at this hotel it's either noise or a dark room
Our only complaint was a strong smell of cigarette smoke one night
We were told it was a nonsmoking floor
The front desk sent someone up (very responsive) but he could not locate the source of the smoke (??) We think it was coming under an adjoining room's door
A wet towel under the door solved the problem
All in all
this is a really nice hotel for the price and a great location
