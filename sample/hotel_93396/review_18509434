As has been written before this is a great central location for a lot of the sights and Broadway. 
The highlights for me were the rooms which were comfortable, quiet and a reasonable size compared to some I have stayed in in NY as well as the check-in and concierge staff who couldn't have been more helpful.
Another plus was confirmed rooms next to our children.
The downside is that the hotel perhaps lacks a little soul as there is no real lobby area to have a drink and relax while waiting for the rest of the party or deciding what to do next. There is the small bar and restaurant but I usually prefer the lobby area for that 15 to 20 minute chill time. They were renovating the lobby so that might address this when completed - like the previous review the renovation whilst disappointing was not a major distraction.
All in all a good hotel - not sure it lives up to a "leading hotel" tag but I would still consider it to stay as it ticked a lot of the boxes with clean, comfortable and quiet rooms and good service coupled with the location.
