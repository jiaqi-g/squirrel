The hotel is only a couple of minutes walk to Times Square which is where everything happens, this makes it alot easier to catch the uptown and downtown loop buses, which start and finish there, also you are central to everything so it is in walking distance. The staff are incredibly helpful, especially Bill, they offer a professional and friendly service. The hotel beds were the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. The best value for money and even though it is near Times Square you could not hear any traffic. Loved it and would definately stay there again.
