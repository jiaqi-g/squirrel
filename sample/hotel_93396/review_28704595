The Iroquois hotel is a small but very pleasant hotel to stay. It is situated in w 44th street between 5th and 6th Avenue and at walking distance of all the sights to see.
The staff is excellent and the rooms are clean and well equiped.
In the surrounding of the hotel there are more than enough restaurants to take your pick.
We stayed for 5 nights and that's even for European standards long enough to see te sights in upper, middle and lower Manhattan. The limousine service to the airport is great (USD 95) and efficient. Everything you ask for can be arranged by the staff of the hotel. The room we had (604) is at w 44th street side but is very quiet. The room are spacious enough for a city hotel.
