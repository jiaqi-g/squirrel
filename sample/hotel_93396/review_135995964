Nothing wrong with this hotel but I don't really know what makes this a 4* hotel with an almost $300 price tag other than its location. I have stayed at much nicer 3* hotels. The service is good and everything is adequate but if this is one of the best rated hotels in New York (currently 24/430 NYC hotels at tripadvisor.com) I'd hate to see what the lower ranked hotels are like. By the way, you get no in/out rights for your car using their valet parking which is $55 per day plus $10 extra for SUVs, something which is common in NYC, but people should know ahead of time, perhaps other hotels offer that???
