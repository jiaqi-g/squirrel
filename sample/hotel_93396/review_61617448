I travel to NY quite a bit for business and stayed at this hotel for the first time. They upgraded me to a suite, which was a great start. The service was very friendly and the hotel was very comfortable. It was nice to stay in a smaller, more personal hotel, when compares to your larger chain hotels (Hyatt, Sheraton, etcs.). Unlike some of thsose larger hotel chains, this hotel was polished on the edges and appointed very nicely throughout. The bathroom was very high end, with the exception of the shower which was out of place in comparison with the quality of the finish in every other aspect of the hotel. I only point that out since I cannot write a review without suggested some area for improvement. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
