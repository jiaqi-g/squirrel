I enjoyed my stay at this hotel mainly due to the staff and the location
Every single member of staff gets a full house from me
they were wonderful
ready to do all they could
I did not try the resturant but the bar was nice and the library room is cozy
The net did not work in my room so there is free internet connection there if needed
My only real dissapointment was in the room
I have never paid as much for a room
and it was very very small
I expected a lot more for the money
But I stress
what the room had
was nice
Good bed
nice bathroom
nice TV
But I would have liked a much bigger room for the price
one of the smallest room I have ever been in
I was told they were all that size so dont expect much
Try the Red Flame diner a couple of doors down
great food at a good price and it is very New York
