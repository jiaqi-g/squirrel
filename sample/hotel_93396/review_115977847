The Iroquois was in a great location, a short walk to so many sights such as Central Park, The Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station and Times Square.
Our room was very good, clean, well proportioned and reasonably quiet (no traffic noise).
The staff were very friendly and helpful, in particular Vanessa, the concierge, who even found us a dentist!
We used the diner a few doors down for breakfast which was really good and would highly recommend Virgil's Real BBQ which is only a block away. 
Our only minor criticism was that our room "key" seldom worked first time, even although we changed it twice.
