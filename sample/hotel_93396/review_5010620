We just returned from five days at the Iroquois. This was my first trip to NYC and could not have made a better choice of hotel. The location is excellent! Close to everything you would want to see or do. The staff is very friendly and so helpful. With only a little over 100 rooms you will appreciate the individual attention you receive and the relaxing atmosphere of this hotel. After a busy day in the city it was so nice to come back to such a pleasant environment. The rooms are beautiful! Very, very clean and well appointed. Large bathrooms with great water pressure. The bed was extremely comfortable and had nice linens. Turn down service was a plus and appreciated the daily weather report card they left along with delicious chocolates. Overall, you cannot go wrong staying here. It is definitely a luxury hotel. The Iroquois will definitely be my first choice of hotel on my next trip to NYC.
