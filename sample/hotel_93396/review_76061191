I am so glad I chose this hotel
It is small but they tell you that up front
even so make sure you believe it
That said for an older hotel it is REALLY clean
the staff is very attentive and all are extremely friendly
the room is very up to date
We never heard outside noise while we were in the room or anything in the hallway
My only problem at the hotel was the smell
We were on a non
smoking floor but you could always smell smoke when you stepped off the elevator and in our room
So if you have smoke allergies this isn't the place for you
if you don't then you won't find a better hotel with such an AMAZING location for this price
I will definitely stay there again
