We went to New York for a long weekend and were so very disappointed in this hotel. We were able to speak with the concierge once while there from a Friday night until a Sunday morning. The carpet in our suite was worn and dirty looking. The screws on the bottom hinge of the bathroom door fell completely out and the fan in the bathroom made a horrible noise before dying altogether. We ordered a bottle of wine from the less the terrible selection and it was the staffer brought it to our room and handed it to my husband at the door unopened to the tune of an added 18% gratuity and service charge. There was no coffee maker in the room and none available in the lobby until after 6:30 a.m. and we had a 7:30 a.m. flight. The halls were very small and again the carpet very dingey and the elevators were very slow. 
There were a couple of positive aspects to this hotel. The other guests were very friendly and the bed was extremely comfortable.
