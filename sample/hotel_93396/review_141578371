My wife and I chose this hotel based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews on this site and others, and it lived up to expectations. We came to New York City to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and see all of the typical sites - from the southern tip and the WTC to Central Park - and this hotel's location was perfect. Times Square was two blocks away, all the main theatres were 2-4 blocks away, and major subway stops were also only a couple of blocks at most. And because of it's nearness to the theatre district, you had a plethora of restaurants to chose from.
The hotel itself was immaculate and in a very safe area, surrounded by other botique hotels, restaurants, and nice bars - always felt safe. The rooms were large enough, for NYC, and the ammenites were great - other than the fact that you had to call for ice; no ice machines. Be sure and check out the Tavern's Keep cocktail bar on the first floor - they serve 1800-1920s era classic cocktails, with top notch ingredients and great presentation.
The front desk staff was good enough, but Vanessa, the Chief Concierge was fabulous. She took care of all of the tasks I needed done in advance - arranging car service for us from Newark, getting a reservation at one of the finest restaurants in NYC for our anniversary, printing out Empire State Building tickets, etc. She even took care of a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for our anniversary - very nice.
The combination of location of the hotel, cleanliness and ammenities, and professionalism of staff made The Iroquois Hotel the perfect choice. I would not hesitate to stay there again, and Vanessa helped us make our 25th wedding anniversary a VERY special occassion.
