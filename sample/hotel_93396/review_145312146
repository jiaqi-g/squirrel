We arrived at 3:00 p
and were greeted warmly by the staff
Warm cider was "on tap" in the lobby
adjacent to the engaging library with its collection focusing on theatres and showbiz history
Our accommodation was a suite on the fifth floor
facing 44th street
This afforded views of the handsome facades of the buildings directly opposite
There was no noticeable traffic noise
The suite was handsomely furnished and included a sofa bed for the third person in our party
The Iroquois is perfectly located in midtown Manhattan
within an easy walk of so many attractions
The block of 44th street on which the Iroquois is located has much history and was written about in a 2012 issue of Vanity Fair
After a pleasant night's sleep
we enjoyed a delicious continental breakfast in the adjoining Triomphe restaurant and
with regret
checked out
but with the expectation of returning
