just back after 1 week unforgetable holidays in New York
we stayed at Iroquois hotel
initially trip was planned for last autumn and we paid this hotel via booking
com (it was non refundable deal) but last moment had to cancel our trip
in spite of it they keep almost all amount on our credit and we used it for one week in may (paid just delta between may and october rates)
old fashioned nicely decorated hotel is located in the center center of midtown
no needs to use subway to get all places of interest
we used subway just to go to brooklyn and downtown
all the rest is really walking distance
reception and concierge Sergio and Bill are superhelpful
the restaurants they recommended were really amazing
clean and quiet room
cosmetique kits from molton brown
complimentory served coffee at morning and fresh lemonade all day long at lobby
definitely will chose this hotel for the next visits and will recommend to all friends
the only moment which seems to be really temporary one is one out of two elevators was out of service
but our last day we saw gigant engine delivery for the second elevator so seems like they will fix it soon
