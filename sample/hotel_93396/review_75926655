the hotel was incredible
i stayed here with my son who was celebrating his 10th birthday and the staff coouldnt have been more helpful
they arranged balloons and the most wonderful cake ever from the fab magnolia bakery i was amazed
the staff here cannot do enough to help
the free internet is brilliant
so was the free dvd rental
rooms were comfortable
spotlessly clean
the location of the hotel was great
just a short walk to times square and 5th avenue
all in all this hotel is a gem and i cant wait to get back there
