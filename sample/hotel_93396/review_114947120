A lovely place
My bellman
who had worked there for more than a decade
told me many employees have worked at the hotel for even longer
They love the Iroquois and it shows
The one drawback
and if you have work to do like I did it's a big deal
is that the WiFi speed was like dialup from the 90s
I know because I did a speed test
I'm not sure if that was a temporary problem
but I was there a week and it was consistently awful even in the lobby
That's why I docked a whole star overall and two on the room
But it's a great place
including the adorable cocktail bar
and I'll be back
