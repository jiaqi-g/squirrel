The iroquois has 3 great things: top location
top staff (friendly and professional) and a charming feeling
There's really not much to complain here and I would totally recommend it and also come back
It just feels nice to have an intimate boutique style hotel in the middle of NYC
I would also like to recommend the restaurant triomphe associated with the iroquois (it was the best restaurant we've been to in NYC)
so good we went even twice
Also worth a recommendation is the little bar "the Lantern's Keep" which is located within the hotel
They serve very delicious and professionaly mixed drinks and it's quite an intimate atmosphere (we saw Michael Emerson there)
So all in all this is just an extremely nice package that really made our NYC special
