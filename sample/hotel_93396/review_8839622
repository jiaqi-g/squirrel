I want to begin by saying that the Iroquois reception and reservation staff are superb
It was their friendly telephone manner that determined our selection of the hotel
As well
we were truly grateful for the bottle of wine and chocolates they gave us in celebration of our 25 year anniversary
We also believe that the amazing room we had was because of the staff wanting us to have a memorable occasion
The sleeping room and bathroom were luxurious
However
the shorten queen size bed felt a bit odd as your feet and legs hang over the end
There is no readily available ice or ice bucket
As well
if you touch anything in the bar fridge
the item's price is automatically added to your bill
So if you are thinking of having a chilled glass of wine
you need to involve housekeeping or make sure that you tell the front desk to deduct any "moved" items from your bill
If you are wanting a cup of coffee in the morning to warm you feet that may have been exposed to the night air
you will need to call room service or go down to the front lobby since there are no coffee makers in the rooms
Having no readily available ice or coffee is not a big deal
And as for a shorten bed the amazing pillows and sheets make up for any discomfort
What reduces our rating of this hotel is the lousy housekeeping
Dirty glasses were not removed and cleaning was minimal
As for complaining about this lack of service
we should have talked to the front desk since contacted housekeeping staff made no apology for their lack of effort
So our recommendation for this hotel is excellent if you get a good rate
We have two other more generic travel complaints
We can't stand bell boys
If we were able to carry our luggage half around the global
why do hotels think it is imperative to pay someone to take our luggage via elevator 100 feet? If we need help
we will ask for it
I would rather just give $5 dollars to a bell boy just to leave us alone
Our next beef is with US airways
who cancelled our flight 2
5 hours before departure without any compensation or assistance in finding alternative arrangements
Many of the 65 stranded passengers spent the night in the LaGuardia airport waiting for the next available flight
Next time weâ€™ll take Blue
