Pros: The location is extremely near the times square( 2 streets away ) and the 5th Avenue and Madison Ave. The hotel is infact just next to Sofitel Hotel .Lots of nearby area for food , supermarket and shopping.The room is quiet and the bed is comfortable.Free coffee in the lobby in the morning.Free wifi is a bonus.Staffs are friendly
Cons: NO electric kettle for boiling water.However, you can ask for free hot water supply from room service.The room is not too spacious for double queen sized room.NO specail view in room .Try not to use the hotel to call for taxi with quote charge of $90 to airport and my friend try to call he taxi company himself which is around $55 only.The other thing is that the lift is very slow indeed.
Restaurant : Red flame and many restaurants along the restaurants are good .
