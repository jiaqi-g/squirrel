I came in for business in the Theater District but was reluctant to stay near Times Square as the tourist scene there makes me nuts. But my travel agent recommended The Iroquois and I'm delighted that she did. It's a classy, calm, good-looking hotel with terrific service -- not too stuffy, not too hip, just right. The room was lovely -- delicious bed linens and a Rothko print on the wall. The location is terrific if you need to be mid-town -- it's just far enough east of Times Square to be out of the madness but close enough for an easy walk.
