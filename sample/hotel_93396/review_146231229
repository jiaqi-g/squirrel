Lovely hotel in a great location
The rooms are well appointed and definitely "cozy"
small but that's fairly typical for the age and location
The hotel is right in the heart of the theatre district
restaurants and shopping
minutes from Times Square and an easy walk to Central Park
The staff is very welcoming and concierge Vanessa is knowledgeable and helpful
