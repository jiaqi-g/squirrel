My husband and I stayed in the executive suite with our daughter and niece in October 2004
The hotel itself was nice and there was an adequate gym with a sauna that we were pleased with
Our room was quite large
with a decent sized living room and queen hide
bed for the girls
The only thing I'd change about the suite layout would be to have the bathroom located between the living and bedroom
As it stands
if one of the girls had to make a trip in the middle of the night
they had to trek through our bedroom
Everything was very clean and the room was well appointed
Minibar and extra costs are clearly marked so you don't get any surprises come checkout time
The highspeed internet worked well
which isn't always the case in NYC hotels
The location is fabulous
You're just a few blocks from Times Square
Rockefeller Center
Fifth Avenue stores and just about anything Midtown has to offer
All in all
a nice little hotel and probably worth the $600 a night we paid for our suite
