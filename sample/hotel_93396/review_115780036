Very little negative to this hotel. Service was good, although could have been better. Room still not serviced by 3pm. No chocolates on pillow every night. However, these are very minor flaws. The overall standard was good. Would I stay here again? Probably not, for no reason other than it did not stand out above others in this category or price range. Staff attentive enough, I just felt that the hotel lacked a personality. In terms of location, it is perfect. Minutes from 5th Ave and Times Square.
