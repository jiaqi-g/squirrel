I stay in this hotel quite often, it has one of the finest staffs of any hotel I have been to in my life....
They remember your name and always want you to be happy, I tell them it is my in passing birthday and they send a bottle of wine to the room....
As far as accomastions go the toilettries and bedding is superb....
I recoommnee this place to a friend whose boss works for a big ceo...and they too became hooked on this charming home away from home in a great location,
