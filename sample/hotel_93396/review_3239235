The Iriquois Hotel is full of wonderful caring people, beautifully appointed rooms, delightful amenties, and little "spoil me" surprises that have made me a loyal fan for life. I simply will not stay anywhere else in Manhattan ever again unless I have to!!!
I was so impressed with the friendly helpfulness of the staff (they even remembered my name!), the "surprises" on my pillow at night, the gratis shoe shine for my morning meeting, a comfortable, well-lit room and fast computer to get my e-mail, a sumptuous bed that even eliminated my usual nightly leg pain, a gorgeous room with a marble bathroom, lovely bathrobe, hair dryer and toiletries, beautiful wood furnishings, down and feathers, immaculatly clean and even a refrigerator, stocked with lots of my favorites!!! Yes, you pay for those, but after a long meeting, it was a nice little treat!!
I arrived to a warm, comfortable, stunningly appointed room, and just loved the quiet and comfort. So much so, I spent as much time as I could there, morning meditation, pre-dinner bath and evening reading, and of course, the news on the TV in the armoire.
And don't let me forget the great restaurant as well. I took time to tell the manager I was so pleased and pleasantly surprised at my "find". He was so gracious and pleased he invited me to speak with the owner. Now tell me, when do you ever get the CEO and Chairman of the Board on the phone?? It is truly understandable, after speaking with them, why this Hotel has everything going for it. No wonder the staff is so loyal and happy in their work.
Stay here, you will love it... it is worth every cent, has the highest rating on Orbitz, and don't even think twice next time about where to stay... I told everyone I know about this Hotel, and know they will kiss me on both cheeks if they take my advise and stay... do it, and have fun!!!
