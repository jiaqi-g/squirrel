This hotel is really a hidden gem. The location is close to everything and the staff/ concierge are first class and very attentive. Some may consider the room small, but it was cozy, comfortable and elegant by my standards. My room was kept immaculate during my stay; after a day of shopping and sightseeing, it was comforting to come back to a clean and orderly room. The beds are heavenly; I wish my bed and pillows at home were as comfortable. It is very quiet here, which is great after a day of sensory overload. When I return to NYC, this will be the place I stay. Two blocks from Times Square, close to the subway, restaurants, shopping...this is where you want to be.
