A superb location on 44th Street midway between Grand Central Station & Times Square
next door to the Alconquin; better
average furnishings in soothing tones
Frette linens
heavy terrycloth bathrobes; rooms have a CD player/clock radio & a desk with adequate work space & lighting
and you can open the windows
a plus in my book; an excellent fitness room & sauna; and a fine staff which is professional
attentive & courteous
but not obsequious
I have stayed in every type of room offered here
the non
suite guestrooms are cozy by out
towner standards [averaging 250
275 square feet]
but this is Manhattan
You can pay much more for even less space
comfort
and service elsewhere
the W hotels
Indeed
one can often book a suite at the Iroquois
with a not
cramped living room doored off from the graciously
sized bedroom & a bath which includes both a soaking tub and separate
in shower
for less than a standard room at many better known hotels
all the rooms at the Iroquois have marble baths [combined tub/shower in non
suite rooms] and are well sound
proofed; I have never heard noise from the rooms around me or the hallways
If you are a very light sleeper
however
you don't want a room which faces onto 44th Street
The Iroquois was first suggested to me several years by the folks at Express Reservations (a great booking service by the way) as being especially appropriate for a businesswoman traveling alone
They were right; I've always felt secure & well cared for there
even at the bar where a solo woman will feel quite comfortable & enjoy having an after
theatre nightcap
And it's been a wonderful place for weekend visits with friends from out of town
In short
I recommend it highly
