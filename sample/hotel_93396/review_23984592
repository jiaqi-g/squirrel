We love the location of this hotel and have stayed in several others in the same vicinity
If you are going to Broadway shows this is the perfect place to be because it's very close by but not in the Times Square hustle bustle
The hotel itself has a pleasant
clubby feel and is much more traditional in decor than most of the other similar type NYC hotels I've seen
The lobby is fairly small and there's a separate room off it called the library where there's some seating and a computer guests may use free of charge
There is also an adjacent bar and restaurant
We did not eat in the restaurant but did have drinks in the bar a couple of times and it was fine
We got a very good rate($180) through one of the booking sites so we were fairly happy with the place
If I'd been paying $300 or more per night we might have been a little disappointed
Our room was on the back side of the building and was very quiet
We were not far from one of the elevators but I was never bothered by noise
Our room was pretty tiny which is certainly not unusual in NYC
It did have a "real" closet which was a plus
The room consisted of a small desk and chair
a bed
a mini
bar and a small chest of drawers
The bed was comfortable and the bed linens were very nice
The bathroom was small but not uncomfortable
The toiletries were Moulton and Brown which are good
We were there for 4 nights but I had very little contact with the staff so I can't really give an opinion on service
There was usually a doorman there to open one of the doors and one of them helped us with our luggage and getting a cab upon departure
The front desk people were fine at check
in and check
Would I stay there again? Certainly if the rate was good
