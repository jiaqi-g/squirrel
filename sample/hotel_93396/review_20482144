After reading many travel books and internet sites on where to stay in New York
we chose the Iroquois
it was the perfect choice
Located just a few blocks from Times Square
the theatre district
great restaurants
5th Avenue
and Madison Avenue
we were able to walk to nearly all points of interest
The staff was very gracious and friendly and the Chief Concierge helped us navigate around the city with ease
We definitely recommend this hotel
