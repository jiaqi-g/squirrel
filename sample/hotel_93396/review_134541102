If you want to be close to to the action but still have a quiet room, this is your hotel. Although the room was small, we did not spend that much time there anyway. Everything was super clean, I loved the robes and the chocolates on my bed. The housekeeping staff was very nice. The front desk staff was super helpful with anything I needed to know, from the train schedule to comedy shows. The porters were also very nice, especially Bill. He made sure we got to airport ok.
