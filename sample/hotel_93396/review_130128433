Beautiful hotel, delicious food. Car service held up due to incredible traffic, and night bartender with spiked hair was arrogant and in a hurry to go home. However, Lisa, the morning desk clerk, could not have been more helpful. The internet had crashed and she helped me print my boarding pass, and even turned up a hair-tie for my daughter! We received a very nice letter and accommodation about the delay in our car, and we'll definitely go back. We'll just have cocktails somewhere else. Too bad.....
