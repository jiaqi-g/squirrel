We stayed three nights for a spontaneous weekend trip in NYC
Even before our stay we got everything organized and prepared very professiobnally by the two concierges Vanessa and Sergio
They managed to letting us have the best nyc trip we could ever have
From theater tickets to reservations in top restaurants to nightclubs
a heli tour and personal advice for the best city sightseeing tours
they have done everything for us
Sergio even managed to arrange an appointment for a luxury appartment inspection
just another example for our superb service experience
Our room was small but very cozily equipped
Bathroom appeared very hygienic
bed was very comfortable
Although we stayed on the 12th floor
we could still hear the cooling system from outside quite loud in our room
In total
the concierge service made the difference for us which we have never experienced in such an intense way before
Thank you Vanessa
Thank you Sergio for your great support :
)
We will definitely come back

Benni
