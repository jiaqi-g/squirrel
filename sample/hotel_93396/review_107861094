This was my first time in New York City so I wasn't sure where the proximity of the hotel was to the sights and neighbourhoods but it turned out to be perfect! While my room was the size of a Kleenex box it was spotlessly clean, very cozy and quiet. The bed was uber-comfy...slept like a rock all cocooned in my toasty duvet. What made it great was Alan, the Concierge. He went out of his way to give me tips and ideas on places to eat, visit and the best way to get there. He really made my trip a success!!
I recommend this hotel to everyone.
