The Iroquois embodies the ultimate in comfort, personal service, location, privacy, and luxury at an amazingly affordable price. The staff is warm and responsive (which is not always the norm in NYC!), the rooms are well furnished and above average size for NYC. The relatively small size, compared to other properties, assures personal service and discretion.
Proximity to the Theater District and Times Square is great for those looking to see the sights, yet the location is off the beaten path by a couple of blocks and quiet for the business traveler.
The Concierge (Marga) made theater and dinner arrangements for my anniversary. The seats were great (even though I had to suffer Legally Blonde with my wife) and Nobu was the perfect spot for our dinner.
Highly recommended for business and leisure.
