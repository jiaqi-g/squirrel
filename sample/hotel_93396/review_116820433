My Father and I stayed at The Iroquois for 4 nights in July over the 4th of July Holiday. Even before we arrived I had e-mailed the hotel for assistance in trying to locate a 4th of July cruise. Vanessa, the concierge, contacted me and provided several suggestions - one of which we took. She also provided us with a discount code for Cirque du Solei tickets at radio city. I cannot say enough about Vanessa. She was extremely responsive even before we arrive as well as while we were there. With regard to the hotel, it is beautiful and very clean. The location is great too! A couple of blocks to Times Square and about 4 or 5 to radio city. The subway is about 2 blocks away. I have been to New York many times, and this is truly the best hotel (service and location) that I have stayed at. I am looking forward to staying there again.
