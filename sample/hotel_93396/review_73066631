Only stayed here for one night but we had a great time
We arrived a bit before check in time but our room was ready
The room was spotless
Small but very well appointed and very comfortable
Bathroom was immaculate and bright
Great water pressure in the shower and no issues with water temperature
The hotel was busy yet I heard no noise in the hall or from the elevator which was near our door
Staff were all very friendly and let me bang away on the chimes they have displayed on the front desk
Excellent location (we saw Lend Me a Tenor at Music Box Theater
highly recommend this show)
The bed was so divine i did not want to get out of it
Frette sheets and towels
Nice robes too
My only regret was not having time to sample the restaurant at the hotel which I will do on my next visit
Thanks for a great trip
hope to see you again soon
