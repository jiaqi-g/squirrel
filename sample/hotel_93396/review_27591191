As a business traveler who has been to New York City over 100 times in the last twenty years
I have stayed at somewhere between 15
20 different hotels
During that time
I developed a personal set of preferences for a satisfying NY hotel trip
listed in order of importance to me:
 1
Very clean and comfortable bed/pillows
 2
Bath with a strong shower and good bath amenities;
 3
Pleasant and helpful staff
 4
Centralized location to wherever I need to go
whether by foot or cab
 5
Free access to internet
 6
Exercise facilities
accessible at any time at no charge
Given these criteria
I am proud to say that I have not stayed at another hotel other than the Iroquois for several years now
Looking back
I am quite amazed that not one hotel that I visited prior to the Iroquois was able to match each of my preferences (in some cases
not even half of them
Given the sprawling
crowded environment of many of the larger NYC hotels that I previously endured
I have become especially fond of the Iroquois' cozy
intimate setting that allows the staff the opportunity to assist on a more personal basis with their guests
That the hotel staff always remembers me by name whenever I return (and I have also seen this with many other visitors) and goes out of their way to make me feel welcome without being intrusive is an absolute luxury
especially when i am over 2
000 miles away from home
