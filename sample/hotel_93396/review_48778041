After reading a number of glowing reviews we looked forward to our stay at The Iroquois
However from the moment we checked in we were disappointed
The welcome we received from the Reception staff was dire
Our first room was very run down and literally vibrated from the air conditioning
We were moved into a standard room for the night
This was again noisy and dated
We were eventually moved to a larger quieter room which was more what you would expect for the price you pay
Throughout our stay we found the hotel staff to be uninterested and offish
They seemed to forget the reason why they were there
Claudia was the only member of staff who was helpful and provided good service
We wouldn't stay here again
there must be better hotels than this in New York
