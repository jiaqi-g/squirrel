The staff were not very helpful
the room was very small (no fridge for the mini bar)
the bed was small (my feet hung off the end)
and thin walls
The finishings are nice enough but there are plenty of hotels in the NYC that are much better than this one
so I would suggest people pick another one
Why risk it when there are better around?
