Stayed at the Iroquois last night and was very pleased. Attention to detail counts, from the courtesy at the front desk checking in (with the lovely tea offered at the front desk); the king sized firm bed and firm pillows; complimentary sparkling water, flat screen TV; an abundance of towels and toiletries in the bathroom, which had lovely hot, hot water; the lovely young woman who came for the turn down service and offered me extra chocolates; and lastly, upon departure being asked if I enjoyed my stay. I've stayed several times at a well-known hotel just a few doors down and never had the service I received at this hotel. Small but elegant. Give it a try.
