I've stayed at the Iroquois on two different occasions and both times it was great. The 1st time, we got a room upgrade and were living large in the Presidential Suite! The second time, we had a small room (as most NYC hotels are), but it was nice and clean and comfortable. The reception staff are very courteous and friendly. It's an ideal location for exploring the city, and if you get on their mailing list, you'll often get special rate offers. I highly recommend this hotel.
