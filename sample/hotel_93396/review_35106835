We stayed July 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. We had an executive King on the 11th floor. The staff was wonderful and polite. The location cannot be beat for walking midtown. We even walked to Central Park twice from the hotel. The bed and room amenities are as good as we have seen anywhere. The free internet was a plus. Many hotels in NY charge 10+ dollars a day for wifi. A lot of people have said the rooms are small....that may be as compared to other regions outside of Manhattan, but it was plenty big enough for us. The diner down the street is a good place to eat. We would definitely stay here again. Parking is in the garage on the right just before you get to the Iroquois, and is about $30 a night if you stay at the hotel. It's about $50 without the hotel validating it. We got a great rate on the room, under 175 a night on Thu, Fri, Sat nights during the 4th.
