Wow, what a pleasant surprise! My spouse and I stayed at the Iroquois for two nights joining another couple who were also staying there. We were grumpy when we arrived as the airline had lost one of our bags but our indisposition soon melted away at the warm reception we received upon checking in and upon entering the lovely plush and comfortable room we were assigned. The bathroom was spotless and elegantly furnished with great toiletries and towels. The comfort of the beds,the quality of the linens and the quietness of the air conditioning were outstanding. Complimentary high speed internet, water and and a turndown service with chocolates were included in the room rate which puts to shame it's next door and now gone to seed neighbour, the outrageously over-priced Sofitel where I had recently stayed. The staff could not have been more helpful, kinder and efficient especially when our suitcase turned up and was brought up to our room. I hope they don't change a thing (including the room rates!) as I will happily make this my New York pied-a terre from now on.
