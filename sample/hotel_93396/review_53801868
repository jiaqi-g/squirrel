The Iroquois Hotel was a great place to stay as a business traveler. I have stayed many hotels in New York and the rooms were superior to many I have stayed in a "chain hotels" in New York. I was in room 310, just around the corner from the fitness room and sauna and was nervous, but the noise was fine. 
I got in too late for the full room service menu, but the late night sandwich was great. Also, the doormen are very helpful and nice.
My only problem was that the wireless service never worked in the 2 nights I was there. We even tried with the front desk laptop (because I was told it was my computer's problem) and no service. But the rest of the hotel had service. I logged an issue, but it wasn't followed up on the next day. In the end, the hotel compensated me, whish was nice. 
Unforutnately, that is why I can't give them a 5 rating.
