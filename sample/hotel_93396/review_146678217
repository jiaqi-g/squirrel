Our annual trip to NYC this year I selected the Iroquois - look no further - its so perfect. The friendliest staff ever. Nice size room - very clean - every night a member of staff brings you chocolates and a weather forecast for the next day. Allan the concierge is wonderful - very knowledgeable and gives his honest opinion - everwhere he suggested was great. The location is perfect and doors away is the cutest little diner that serves a great brealfast. Can't wait to go again next year. You can walk to all the great shops on Fifth - and Macy's is also not too far away.
