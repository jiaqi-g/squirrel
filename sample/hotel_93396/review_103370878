we loved the location. very close to everything, but pretty quiet street (as for nyc:). best place to stay for newcomers.
really small rooms, even deluxe ones. but it is common things for nyc hotels. clean rooms and very comfortable bed. very helpfull staff. we had to change dates of our travel due to baby's illness, and the hotel rebooked new dates for us without any additional charges even tacking into account it was package with special non-returnable rates.
rooms with street view are better than with courtyard view.
