We loved the location
Very close to everything
but pretty quiet street (as for NYC:)
Best place to stay for newcomers
Really small rooms
even deluxe ones
But it is common things for NYC hotels
Clean rooms and very comfortable bed
Very helpfull staff
We had to change dates of our travel due to baby's illness
and the hotel rebooked new dates for us without any additional charges even tacking into account it was package with special non
returnable rates
Rooms with street view are better than with courtyard view
