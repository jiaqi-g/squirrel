Stayed for 5 nights and would recommend this Hotel to anyone, staff are friendly and helpful and smile. Rooms are excellent, clean and nicely funished, the rooms are a little on the small size but hey your not there to sit in your room all day. I've stayed in a good few hotels over the years, first time a hotel exceeded my expectations, hotel added some lovely little touches like turning down your bed and leaving a little chocolate on the pillow with tomorrows expected temprature, does not sound like a lot, but what a nice touch! Really enjoyed my stay in NY, lovely location, 5 mins walk from times square, both my wife and I loved the place, if you dont then there is something wrong with you.
