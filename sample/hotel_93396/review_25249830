This hotel was so beautiful and quaint
I prefer the luxury of a big hotel in a small intimate setting
There was not 1 detail overlooked in this place
Everything from the beautiful lobby to the ultimate comfortable bed
to the central location
we were in heaven
I recommend this be the only place you stay in NYC
