We stayed for a long weekend with our 17
yr old daughter to celebrate her school graduation
The staff were excellent
especially Alan the Concierge
who helped us with all our restaurant bookings and sundry other advise
We had a suite
which worked really well
as it was a proper suite (ie the bedroom was in a second room
not just an open
plan mini suite)
The room was spacious enough and the bed extremely comfortable
The rate represented very good value indeed
given the excellent location and service
