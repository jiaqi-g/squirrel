My husband and I stayed at the Iroquois for 2 nights over the weekend of October 23-25. We have definitely found our "home away from home" while in New York City. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the beds are to die for. The mattresses and Frette linens are unbelievable and as another reviewer said "it felt like sleeping on a cloud". Amazing. The location is absolutely perfect for nearly everything you want to do. We only took a cab to the Guggenheim but then walked back, stopping along the way. We also took a cab when the torrential rains came but otherwise would have just walked everywhere. We didn't try the restaurant, opting to eat at the Red Flame just down the block for breakfast and our usual favorites for dinner. However, we will try Triomphe the next time we're in town due to the fabulous reviews it gets here. You will enjoy your stay here if you like location, location, location and a truly lovely boutique hotel with the best beds ever!
