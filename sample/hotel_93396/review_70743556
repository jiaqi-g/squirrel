My husband just did a quick overnight in the city to visit friends and didn't want to pay a fortune for a nice hotel. We booked a standard room at The Iroquois and hoped for the best. When we got there, they let us check in early and even upgraded our room for free! From moment one the staff were courteous, friendly and very helpful. Our room was small but very clean and with a great bathroom. Even our friends in the city were impressed (they met us there to start our day) - they will reccomend The Iroquis from now on for out of town guests. Everyone from the concierge to the desk staff to the doorman were friendly and great to talk to! the only consideration is that the place isn't super 'cheap' and our room had a view of a fire escape - but this is pretty standard for a downtown hotel - in the end a good value. I'll be staying there whenever we go back to NYC in the future!
