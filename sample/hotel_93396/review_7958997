My wife and I stayed 4 nights and were very happy, this was our first trip to NYC, read the reviews on this site and they were all very accurate. The rooms were small but very nice and clean. Staff was great. Would surely stay here again, the location is perfectly in the middle of it all. Enjoyed this gem!
