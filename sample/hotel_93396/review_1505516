We just returned from 5 days in New York City during the Thanksgiving holiday
My husband and an 18 year old daughter
and 21 year old son
We all loved the cozy
quiet hotel
It is close to everything we needed and not a large loud chain hotel
The staff was very helpful and friendly
We had two adjoining rooms and they were all we hoped for
We will stay there on our next visit
