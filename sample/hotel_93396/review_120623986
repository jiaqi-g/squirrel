I travel quite a bit
and typically stay at four
or five
I would definitely rate this as one of the nicest places I've stayed at anywhere
Excellent service and free internet make this a bargain
The hotel is an independent
and I decided to stay here after spending a few days at the Manhattan Sofitel next door
because Expedia had a great air/room deal
and the Iroquois looked cozier
Couldn't be happier I did
Great location
rooms are small
but that's midtown
Wonderful location for theatres and Central Park
and manageable on foot in nice weather if you want to stroll to the Museums on the Upper East Side or down to Greenwich Village
Close to all subway lines if you're not up for that
I would stay here again & again & again
look no further for your perfect Manhattan home
from home
