Great hotel in perfect location
not one of those huge anonymous institutions
A bit on the old side
but thats the side effect of having a history and atmosphere
We stayed in a suite which was great
the beds are really wonderful
but paying list price for it seems a bit overpriced
Staff was friendly and helpful
