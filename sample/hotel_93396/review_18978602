I can’t say enough good things about the Iroquois
It’s a small and quiet jewel
just blocks away from Times Square
Although the rooms are consistently clean
comfortable and well appointed
it’s the staff that makes the Iroquois feel like a home
The genuinely warm hospitality I receive every time I stay is rarely found elsewhere—
especially in New York
I highly recommend this hotel
