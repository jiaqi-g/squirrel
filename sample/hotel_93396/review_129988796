This hotel is small luxury hotel staffed by the most phenomenal people
From the time you to step on to the front door
check in
to time you get to your room the experience is truly outstanding
The conceirge staff
Sergio and Vanessa are incredible
They know you by name
they are warm and professional and cannot do enough for you just so that you can navigate the city well and have the best reservation at the best restaurants
The bell hop team are equally helpful topping off the experience in a memorable way
As it was raining one morning
the bell hop was quick rto offer an umbrella
which shocked me
Ireem at the front desk did everything to accomodate my requests of whuich there were a few of them
She was cordial
helpful and as accomodating as the circumstances would allow
The area is at the center of many poignant and great places in Manhattan
The theatre district was a stones throw away and shoppingall around you
Many convenient but elegant restaurant to dine and enjoy
I would stay here again for all the reasons sited but most importantly becaue of the fine staff
