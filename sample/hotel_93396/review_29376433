This wonderful hotel would be a true gem in any city
but couple that with their location (only 1
5 blocks from Times Square) and this is a fantastic place to stay
We have always been impressed with the service here
and for almost ten years have made it our only destination when we travel to New York
Small touches that really matter include a complimentary DVD library
an umbrella in the room for those unexpected rain showers
and luxurious linens and towels
We look forward to every trip
