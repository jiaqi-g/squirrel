I stayed at the Iroquios hotel during a business conference July 25-27, 2005 in a standard queen size room. I had read the reviews from this site regarding the rooms because my biggest concerns are cleanliness and space. I am willing to pay the extra money to have clean sheets, minus the bugs! Anyway, the rooms were clean, no bugs, and spacious. I would definitely stay there again, without a doubt. The price was reasonable as well to be in midtown area ($275.06 per night). Please view the pictures I have attached.
