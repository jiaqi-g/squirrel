This was my second stay at The Iroquois and, as with my first visit, everything was perfect! I stayed for three nights over the recent Columbus Day weekend.
The location couldn't be better. It's convenient to everything and right off Times Square.
The bed is one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in.
The room and bathroom were spotless! They give you Molton Brown toiletries - shampoo, lotion, etc. - which are an added bonus, because those products are wonderful. And there were nice, comfy bathrobes as well. Also an added bonus: the in-room safe, which was really easy to use.
Every single staff member that I had contact with over those three days couldn't have been nicer. From the desk staff to the bellmen, everyone was super nice and very professional.
The room was small, but they're all small in NYC and I've been in smaller. Plus the room was laid out very well and there was plenty of room in the bathroom.
The only reason I don't stay here more often is that it is often a bit pricey and you can't have more than two people in a room. So if you're going with a family, this would be out unless you book two rooms. 
This time, everything was overpriced for Columbus Day weekend and I happened to get a special price through the travel site I booked with and I jumped at it.
I highly recommend The Iroquois.
