My wife and I stayed at this hotel last week and were very disappointed. First my wife's purse was stolen from the closet and then we were billed for the bar in our room and never used it. We received a typical corporate letter stating that they are sure their staff did not take the purse. The bar bill was removed at check out but the person at the front desk stated they charge for the bar all the time then have to correct the problem. We expected more from a hotel rated as high as this one is.
