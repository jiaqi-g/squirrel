Three friends and I stayed at the Iroquois while in New York for a delightful week end this summer. It could not have been a better experience. The staff was so friendly and helpful. They made us feel special and at ease from the beginning of our visit.We also found the restaurant superb. The location was a plus for us because we planned to see several 
broadway plays.
