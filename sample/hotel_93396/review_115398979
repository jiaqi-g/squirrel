My wife and I stayed at The Iroquois for five nights to celebrate our anniversary
and enjoy some time in New York
When we first arrived at the hotel one of the doormen greeted us at the car
unloaded our bags
and proceeded to guide us into the hotel
Check
in was a breeze
and even though we arrived a bit early our room was ready for us
Chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of sparkling water awaited us in the room
which was refreshing after we had had a bit of a stressful day prior to our arrival
The concierge desk was very helpful and friendly when assisting with reservations
tickets for shows
and great even just to talk to
All the staff in general were friendly
genuine and attentive
and always seemed to ask if there was anything they could do for us
We did not eat at Triumph
but we did visit the cocktail bar Lantern's Keep three nights we were at the hotel (they are closed Sunday and Monday)
Quite simply some of the best cocktails we've ever had
We stayed in a suite
which we felt was necessary considering we would be there five nights
This gave us some breathing room
and a calm place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a little while in the afternoon
The living room was well appointed
with a mini
Bose i
Pod dock
sofa/love seat
The bedroom had ample space
and the king size bed was great
Only thing I would change would be to get a duvet for the bed in the summer time that is a little lighter as it got a bit warm for me at night
The air
conditioning worked very well
and it was in the 90s the whole time we were there
Noise from the street was inaudible most of the time
Housekeeping was great
the room/bathroom was always clean
Overall
The Iroquois is a great hotel in midtown
If you want to have an "old" New York experience
with quality service
amenities
and well appointed rooms
stay at The Iroquois
