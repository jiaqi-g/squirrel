I had the misfortune of vising NYC during the Blackout of 2003
Within fifteen minutes of checking into the hotel
the power outage occured
The staff couldn't have been more considerate
understanding
and helpful
The manager/owner pulled his car up outside the front door and played his radio so that we could find out what was going on
As it got dark
they provided us with fresh fruit and drinks
Our only light source was from the car parked on the sidewalk (again the managers car)
shining it's headlights into the darkened lobby
With bedtime approaching
the bellhops and staff helped everyone to their rooms with the few candles and flashlights available
They were very patient with even the grumpiest of guests
The staff remained calm
cool and collected throughout the entire ordeal and remained so after things returned to normal
Many of the larger hotels actually turned their guests out during the ordeal and I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't stayed at the Iroquois
I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone
