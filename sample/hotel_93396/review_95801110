The Iroquois surpassed even my high expectations after reading the glowing reviews. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, the location is ideal and the compact room was cozy, comfortable and decorated tastefully. The hotel has a European feel to it and the personalized service is impressive. I felt very welcomed from the moment I arrived.
