Stayed at this hotel while in NYC. Hotel is clean, cosy and welcoming with a classic decor, staff are also welcoming and friendly. The location is also hard to beat being close to broadway, the subway and reasonably close to Central Park. Price seemed reasonable for the location but the room was a bit smaller than what we would have liked (couple + 6 yr old) and with three suitcases we had to place one on the floor near the door since there was no where else to put it. Prices for food and services seemed a little steep (not sure how they compare with other hotels in the city) but we found a diner only a few doors down which had good food at good prices. Hotel would suit a couple who only intend to use it as a base and don't intend spending much time there but being in NYC that's not hard to do. A positive experience overall.
