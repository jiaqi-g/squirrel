In the majority of ways the hotel is an acceptable hotel in New York. However, if you expecting a luxury boutique hotel, it is not this. Sadly, it also prices itself as a luxury boutique. Take a look at a few bathroom photos I will upload and they will show that the rooms are in need of renovation and repair in some areas.
In terms of positives, the room services and food service is good, and it is a good and handy location if you want midtown. Staff friendless is alright but a little fake, they will say hello in the way one would expect, may have a conversation with you, but then completely forget anything about you next time they see you.
Overall for a slh one would expect a high standard room and hotel facility, together with staff that tend to your every need. I will not come back.
