Booked two , non-smoking rooms, one double and one queen on 5th floor. Their 2nd floor has some smoking rooms, fyi. The entire stay was fantastic. TEach and every member of the staff was exceptionally professional and politely personable. Beds, linens, bath were impeccably appointed, very clean. I booked on-line using the hotel's website and found a better, summer rate than on the travel websites I usually use. While the hotel was perfect, our meals at the Triomphe restaurant were unbelievably delicious. Each bite was heavenly. Hope to go again soon. Wouldn't stay anywhere else.
