My stepmother and I stayed here during the incredible heat wave of early August 2006 to see JK Rowling speak at Radio City
The hotel is in a great location
down the street from Times Square and is a really easy walk to the Music Hall
The food at the adjoining restaraunt was fantastic and offers an early "theater" dinner if you have to eat early
The hotel room itself was just gorgeous
and the decor was really beautiful
We only had one little snag that was mostly our fault: We misread the time that our train departed and had to really hurry out
The hotel employee was unable to get a taxi for us
and after 10 minutes said it would probably faster to walk
Not sure if you've ever run from Times Square to Penn Station in 105 degree humidity
but I wouldn't recommend it and it surely was not faster than a cab
And we missed the train
Oh well
Otherwise
a great stay and I'd definitely go back
