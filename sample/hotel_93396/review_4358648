For many years
we stayed at the Mayfair Hotel on 65th and Park
it was once a Regent
then it was an Italian chain
and it had Le Cirque
but mostly it was a very personal luxury hotel
After it turned into a condo or something
we tried many hotels
the St
Regis (too big and snobby)
the Helmsley Palace (too big and impersonal)
Gaansevort (very nice but lousy restaurant and crowd is young
Regency (nice but pretentious) until we found the Iroquois
First of all
the street is great
with clubs
restaurants and other neat hotels
Secondly
the convenience to the theatre district
Grand Central
Fifth avenue shopping and general mid town
Secondly
the rooms are absolutely beautiful
very Ralph Lauren look
with English traditional furnishings and very comfortable
The staff is great and the bar is the place in the area
and with a small restaurant that is as good as anyplace in the midtown area
Internet connections are free
they have a library
a gym
the best breakfast in Manhattan in a special room
they get all your messages
they have a theatre concierge where the best tickets are yours
and then the great bar and restaurant
We had an occasion to meet the manager and he remembers every thing you need and overall
we would stay no where else when we go to New York
