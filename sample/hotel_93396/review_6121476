The Iroquois is in a perfect location for seeing all the sites and only a couple of minutes from Times Square. 
The Iroquois has well equipped bedrooms but they are small. We booked a superior room which was very comfortable and clean and the Molton Brown toiletries were an added bonus. 
The coffee served in reception each morning was a great way to start the day.
I would recommend the Iroquois although I did think it was expensive. However, we stayed during the marathon weekend and we haven't been to New York before so it's difficult to say whether there are better places to stay which are better value for money.
