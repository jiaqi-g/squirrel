I stayed at te Iroquois last year with some girlfriends and when my daughter announced that she wanted to spend her 18th Birthday in New York
I did no hesitate in booking this hotel again for our trip
We spent six nights in New York and I can only say that the hotel added to what was a fabulous birthdayy treat
I tried to book the 'Classic' Room (two Queen beds)
but they could not accommodate us on all of the nights so they offered us a 'King Size' bedroom instead
It was perfect
The room was serviced every day
clean frette linen and we even got a turn down service every evening
The bathroom was clean with both a shower and a bath and the Molten Brown toiletries were a special touch
I had to use the laundry one day and I was most impressed with the one day service and a reasonable price to match
I would highly recommend the Concierge Service
Angelic was able to find Lady GaGa tickets for me and my daughter and at a decent price
All of the front of house staff were pleasant and most helpful in aiding with finding taxis or giving out directions to restaurants etc
The location is perfect
turn right and walk a couple of blocks and you are in Times Square
turn left and walk one block and you are on 5th Avenue
Fantastic
I will definitely be returning to this Hotel when I am next in New York and have already told a friend to book in for New Year
