Nice hotel with a friendly staff
We grabbed a last minute package to nyc
The rate was great
but now I know why
They put my wife and I (I'm 6'2") in the smallest room I've ever stayed in
It could only fit a double bed
which was way too small for me
It was about 225 sq
This room may suffice for a small single traveller
but not 2 people
They should never have given us a room like this
If we had a nicer/larger room
we might have like the hotel a lot more
