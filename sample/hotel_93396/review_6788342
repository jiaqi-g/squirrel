Last summer, I went to NY with some friends for my third time, and we were very pleased with The Iroquois. The location is excellent, close to Times Square and the Fifth Avenue, but in a quieter street. The lobby is small, ordinary and disappointing, but the rooms, although small, are very comfortable and include a well stocked mini-bar, a DVD player and a big flat screen TV. Bathrooms (which for me are very important) are spacious, clean and luminous. The staff is nice and helpful, and speaks fluent Spanish. There is aslo a small gym that during my stage was empty all the time.
