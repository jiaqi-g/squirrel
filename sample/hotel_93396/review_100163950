I would like to thank the staff for making our stay wonderful, It was a girls weekend in New York and we wanted to have fun. The front desk clerk, Elvis was friendly and very helpful. I can't say enough about the staff. It really makes a difference when the staff love what they do. I will be in New York in April with my family and will stay here again. Great, clean hotel.
