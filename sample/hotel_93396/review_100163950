i would like to thank the staff for making our stay wonderful, it was a girls weekend in new york and we wanted to have fun. the front desk clerk, elvis was friendly and very helpful. i can't say enough about the staff. it really makes a difference when the staff love what they do. i will be in new york in april with my family and will stay here again. great, clean hotel.
