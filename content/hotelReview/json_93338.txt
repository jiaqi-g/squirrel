We stayed here based on reviews of family friendly hotels. I'm not sure exactly how they are more family friendly than any other hotel except for the suites and kitchenettes for budget-conscious families. There weren't any special programs for kids, but we did see other families there. For NYC, a nice sized Queen suite gave us everything we needed. Didn't use the kitchen for our overnight stay but definitely would in the future. Rooms were comfortable (ok... a little tight at the foot of the bed but not like some complaints described), the amenities were really appreciated, e.g., free wifi, Keurig coffee service in room, desk area, energy efficient rooms (you put your room card in a device that controls the electricity to save energy while you're out). Lovely bathrooms (although they need a hand towel holder), but really comfortable. We are a family of 3 so the kiddo slept on the pull-out sofa. Room was in good condition-- it appears that shade of green must be the theme, but its nice. The bellman held our luggage after checkout to allow us to stay in the city and not have to worry about our bags. Parking garage is right around the corner -- very close. Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away.

When we arrived back after just over an hour the room was ready and we were allocated a room on the 21st floor (there is only 25 floors in the hotel). I do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and I managed to survive the constant use! :). We arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room (possibly because I emailed in advance) and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch. The room was excellent, large, spacious, very clean with more than enough storage. The views from our huge window were fantastic! The concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy (this was my partners 6th time in NYC and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge). \nEven though NYC pretty much shut down for a few days, the housekeeping service was still available (albeit on a reduced staff) and they were very polite. If you are there for a few nights (we were for 5) I would recommend that on your first morning to leave a $10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave $2/$3 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletries/towels/pillows etc or anything else you may need. \nThe hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane. \nWe were both very impressed with Hotel Beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year.

Down the raod is \"Big Nicks\" diner which is open late at night after the theatre has finished. \nWhen travelling on the subway get the $29.00 seven day pass. You can see all of the New York sights via the subway. The subway is very easy to use as well.

We wanted to stay in an area that had a more local neighbourhood feeling so we thought the Upper West Side would do the trick. I was really impressed by the value of this hotel. With the tax we paid $344 a night for a King room. Other hotels I researched were even more then that and the pictures didn\u2019t seem as nice. We got there late at night and there was a big crowd in the lobby and low and behold Robin Williams was there visiting with fans. I assumed he was performing at the theatre next door but not sure. Seemed like a sign of a good visit. The room was very large. Much bigger then other New York hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. As well the d\u00e9cor was really nice and bed very comfortable. It definitely seemed like they had renovated recently. Before our arrival I emailed to request a quiet room on a higher floor. They gave us a room on the top floor which is 25th. Our room was across from the elevators which I thought might be a problem for noise but we barely heard anything from the hallway. As well I had read reviews about the elevators being slow but we never had an issues with them. We had chatted with some local residences of the hotel that had been living there for 25 years. It was interesting to stay in a place with such history. When we woke up our first morning we were stunned at the view. A great way to start everyday. \nThe subway is right around the corner which is really convenient. At the last minute I considered switching hotels to somewhere around Greenwich Village because I thought that we might be spending hours on the subway but the express train to Time Square is super fast. We would be downtown in around 15 minutes so getting around wasn\u2019t a problem at all. \nHaving the Viand Caf\u00e9 downstairs is really convenient as well. We arrived late at night and it was so nice to pop down for a snack and drink. On our last day we had to leave for our flight early so again it was nice to have a reasonably priced meal downstairs.

A really nice wine store is just downstairs too and a Duane Reade closeby if you forgot any toiletries. \nThere\u2019s lots of shopping around the area too which we didn\u2019t expect which was great.

I moved out of NY a year ago, and miss it terribly. I wanted to be right back where I used to live. I was a little hesitant about the Beacon, because I had been in there years ago. And I mean over 20 years ago, and it wasn't very nice. But it has REALLY changed!!! It's VERY nice!!! Let me break it down from the big picture to the small details.\nLocation: Perfect for me. I love the Upper West Side. I spend most of my time in Central Park (walking, photographing, running, bird watching, people watching, going to the zoo, bike riding, exploring, etc). My goal when I lived in NY was to live as close to Fairway (a unique grocery store) as humanly possible. The Beacon is right across the street. And the Beacon has kitchens in each room, so I actually did buy food at Fairway and prepared it in my room. But back to the location description. 75th and Broadway is the epicenter of 3 amazing cupcake shops, a famous bakery, Fairway, Zabars, Juice Generation (great smoohties), Harry's Burritos, Big Nicks, Shake Shack, the Park, three excellent gyms and a couple great yoga places. If your vacation plans don't revolve around food and exercise, you'll think that list was strange. But for me, it was perfect. It was like being home. I should also mention Lincoln Center and the Natural History museum are very close by. All the museums on the East Side are walkable through the park. If you're more into the downtown scene/night life or Broadway, maybe it's not for you. But hey, the subway is RIGHT THERE, so transportation is convenient.\nHotel: The lobby, staff, elevators were all superior for a non-brand hotel.\nHallways: Carpeted, fairly quiet, wide and clean.\nRooms. Bright, clean, newly remodeled, spacious, welcoming, pleasing finishes, comfortable. Each room (as far as I know) has a kitchen (with dishes/pots and pans),a safe, tv, free wifi, extra blankets, good toiletries, ironing board, luggage rack, comfortable beds and pillows. Our room was amazing. It was room 2112, on the 21st floor. It was a corner room with a view I could NOT keep my eyes off of. One window faced Central Park and the East side. One faced downtown. We had views of Times Square, The Chrysler Building, Broadway (the street) and the Ansonia-which is a gorgeous building, and on the East, views of some of my very favorite architecture (the San Remo!), Citicorp, the Sherry Netherland and that glorious Park. We slept with the blinds open. We watched the sun rise over the buildings, We couldn't stop looking or taking pictures. I had lived in NY 10 years, in many apartments, and I never had a view like that. \nBTW there were also windows in the kitchen and Bathroom.The one in the bathroom opened.\nI will ALWAYS stay at this hotel when I'm in NY. I think, over the years, I've stayed in almost every hotel that city has to offer, including the Plaza and the Waldorf, and this was by far, my favorite.", "author": {"username": "Intrepid_Traveler13", "num_cities": 39, "num_helpful_votes": 74, "num_reviews": 80, "num_type_reviews": 45, "id": "FD711E1ED5A2DA3F69425CDD77A80E5A", "location": "San Francisco, California"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "November 10, 2012", "id": 145090743, "via_mobile": false}

When we woke up the first morning, it was fantastic to open the blinds to see New York city in all its urban glory. It was really exciting and we could not wait to get going. As soon as you step out, you are right in the centre of everything you came to New York for.\nWe understand the beds are new since a year and we slept like babies which was fantastic because we suffered no jet lag (from UK) and I was found I was sleeping for 10 hours! (unheard of). Not only are the windows sound proofed but the hotel is in a quiet zone where traffic must resist honking and beeping at certain times of the night. For the 4 nights we were guests, we did not hear a single sound from the corridors either last thing at night or early morning which is highly unusual. Probably the best sleep I have had overseas.\nWe had a kitchenette which is ok - one can knock up a bit of breakfast but nothing too complicated. There is no worktop space and about 3 cooking utensils with enough cutlery for 2 people. The fridge is great for fruit, eggs and juice. A coffee machine is provided and a kettle.\nEverything worked like clockwork. The only comment would be that I missed having a bar, a communal area to fall into after a long day's walking the great streets and sights of Manhatten. Loved to have come back for a cocktail and communal chat with other residents, etc. \nThe hotel is billed as a 3 star but we can categorically say the bedrooms are 4 star. We understand a bar is being added from Feb 13 and I hope this does not mean they gain a 4th star allowing the rates to increase. Its not cheap for a 3 star but NY is not cheap.

This hotel is perfect if you are are going on holidays to Manhattan with a family.\nWe were on a family trip of a lifetime to New York for a few days and this hotel made it the perfect holiday. Our room was on the 7th floor and there was buckets of space. The bedroom had two double beds and the sitting room was large with sofa, armchair and dining room table for 4. The kitchen had a normal (by Irish standards) sized fridge and cooker plus a microwave. It was just an alcove really but perfectly adequate for preparing / heating up the goodies from Fairways.\nThere was a laundry across the hall from us which also had two payphones - so we could use prepaid phone cards to call home very cheaply. Tea and coffee were provided. The coffee perculator was intuitive to use and made exceptionally nice coffee.\nFairways supermarket is directly across the road. It is not for the faint hearted as it is a warren, and very busy. At the meat and deli counters you need to take a ticket and wait for your number to be roared out (took me a while to figure this out!)That said, it is a tourist attraction in its own right for those more used to pushing a trolly around Tescos or Lidl. Just don't take kids when you are doing that first supplies shop especially if they are just off the plane and tired. We remained pretty much on Irish time while in New York as it was only for a few days so meals from Fairways at the dining table in our room was ideal rather than restaurants with children.\nThe subway is left out of the hotel and two minute walk. There is a self service machine on the way in. We put $20 on a metrocard which allowed the four of us to be swiped through one after the other. You can see your balance at the turnstyle as you swipe. Just be sure you know your uptown from your downtown before you travel. The subway stops at convenient points for all tourist attractions.\nCentral Park is two blocks away and a haven to come back to in the afternoon after sighseeing.

I'm the trip planner and I always try to find a different area for us to stay in. This year, it was the Upper West Side. My research showed that the Beacon was the best deal for the dates of our trip. October is a very expensive time to come to New York so when I was able to find a 1 bedroom suite for less than 400.00 a night, I made the reservation.\nThe hotel is in a lovely, residential area of New York. When I win the lottery, that's exactly the area I want to live in! We arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 AM on Friday, Oct.5th after a very long cab ride from LGA. Note to self- don't plan our next trip to NYC to arrive during rush hour. Lucky for us, our room was ready when we checked in. The manager on duty was David. He took such good care of us during our stay. This was our 8th annual girl's trip to NYC and as I mentioned we always stay in a different area. The service at this hotel was the best we've ever experienced.\nThe suite was lovely. Our room was on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city. The queen bed was so comfortable and the living area had a pull-out couch and a roll-a-way was sent up for us, which was a nice touch. Loved the fully stocked kitchen. The hotel has been renovated recently and our suite was immaculate. One of my favorite things was having a delicious cup of coffee each morning. There is a Fairway market directly across the street and a wine store next door. Very convenient!\nWe had a wonderful trip to NYC as always. Had tickets for the Kelly and Michael show, Jimmy Fallon, Huckabee, and saw an Off-Broadway show, Cougar the Musical. Walked the entire High Line at night, went to Chelsea Market, shopping at Macy's,and had some great pizza in Soho just to name a few of the highlights.\nPlanning another trip to this great city in January, with my husband this time.

Furthermore, when we asked for more information on the call bill (they gave us the time, not the duration of the calls), the man at reception got quite annoyed and basically implied that we must be idiots if we can't see that the international calls are what cost so much (yes...! but can you tell us how you got to the cost please? the duration?? the rate???). No matter what we said, he just kept saying that it was all written on the bill (on the bill was actually the time of the calls, written in 24 hour time) and the rate is whatever unknown rate they are charged (probably using gold cables being exchanged through luxembourg) plus 75% and scoffing and waving the bill away. He would have clearly seen this was not the case if he'd chosen to listen to us rather than scoffing at our stupidity and gesturing to talk to the hand. Absolutely get a phone card even if, like us, you have no intention of making calls anyway. Or, just use your foreign mobile, its actually WAY cheaper. You never know when your bank might freak out over security and cancel your cards or someone at home has an urgent problem.\nThat aside, this hotel is pretty good for a middle of the road place in NYC. We stayed with our two young children, aged 2 and 3 years old and the location is fantastic. You can easily walk to loads of child-friendly attractions including the children's museum, the natural history museum, central park and even the Met by walking through the park. All the museums and galleries also run children's programming so there's even more to them than just looking at the exhibits.\nThe kitchens were VERY basically supplied so even though they say that you have a full kitchen, you can't really cook much. There are no dishes/pans suitable for the oven so its completely redundant. There are also no dishes suitable for cooking food in the microwave... except maybe 4 small plates, 4 dinner plates and 4 shallow cereal bowls. I suppose you could heat a TV dinner in the packaging it comes in or heat baby food etc, otherwise you're completely limited to what you can produce on the stove with a small frypan, one spatula and one small saucepan.\nThe hotel suggests that you contact the Babysitters Guild direct for babysitting services, which we did and we absolutely loved our sitter whose name was Amy.\nThe doormen are lovely and will receive parcels for you if you shop up a storm and need to have things delivered.\nThere is a very handy coin-operated laundry room on one of the floors which costs $1.75 for each box of detergent, wash or dry load.\nThe rooms are small but furnished nicely.

I was travelling with my two children (aged 12 and 8) so our needs are a bit different to when we are travelling as a whole family. The Beacon worked well for us - its more than a hotel room with a bit more space and the location is excellent as it just ten minutes away from the action, but not in a touristy area, so you feel like you are actually living in New York as oppose to holidaying. The beds were a bit smaller than I expected - I would say the two beds are more like King singles than doubles so it was a bit of a squash with an adult and a child in one bed and definitely would not work for two adults that need space. However the rooms are well laid out and have everything you need. Housekeeping is good and unlike others we had no problems with bugs or anything of that nature. The sitting room is of a good size and a welcome respite at the end of a busy day to be able to stock the fridge with a few drinks and chill without having to order room service etc. The area has plenty of nice local eateries (so cheap for someone coming from Australia) and the proximity to Central Park is a lovely walking/running start to any day. We did not eat in but there is a tiny kitchen with microwave and small cooker, so if you wanted to it would be practical to have light meals. There is a laundry on the 7th floor which is great especially as I put some laundry with the concierge on the first day and it call came back dry cleaned - even t shirts!! So having access to the laundry is great with kids etc. The rooms are also very reasonably priced for New York and the staff really helpful. Its not the sort of place if you are looking for a couples break with facilities on hand but if you are looking for a family hotel with more space than a hotel room, this is perfect.

Two more of our party were moved the following day and the family member sleeping on his own didn't bother changing rooms as the room was adequate for single occupancy (which I discovered subsequently) is what they are assigned for - so why three couples were given these rooms I don't know. So beware if allocated a room on any floor ending 01 - tiny, corner room with small bed and far too small for a couple. Diner next door (Viand) was excellent for breakfast - there are no facilities at all at the Beacon.

I'm not allergic to pets but being alerted of their presence by the hallway odor was unexpected. This is a very old building with no AC in the corridors.

I will spare you the details! If interested, go to TripAdvisor.com and look for my entry under \"Big expectations, even bigger disappointment\".\nAt Beacon Hotel we were greated by hospitable, understanding and helpful manager and a front desk lady.

Although we got ourselves into a \" 2 for the price of 3 situation\", paying for the same night accommodation twice, we do not regret our decision even a tiny bit. \nWe loved Beacon Hotel so much that before leaving I booked a suite for our September visit! \nAnd what's not to love there? Crisp, clean, modern, spacious rooms; filled with light and offering good city views, fully equipped kitchenette; small but lovely bathroom, and the staff ready to help you. They set the standards high for the equivalent hotels in the neighborhood. I was told that most of the profits go to the continuos facilty improvements, and it shows. \nFor all travelers seeking a quiet NYC neighborhood (with plenty of high end markets and restaurants fitting every budget), as well as proximity to transit, Central Park, and cultural venues - Beacon Hotel is a place to be.\nDon't get discouraged by the comments of elevators out of order.

There is cutlery, a bottle opener, and cutting board, but no knife usable to cut fruit, salami, etc. There's not exactly a place to eat, but we were fine sitting on the sofa and using the coffee table.\nAir conditioning a bit fiddly - maybe there was a way to stop it cycling off and on all night but we just lived with it.\n-----\nThe housekeeping staff was very friendly; the front desk people were fine.

Those rooms that have the Broadway view would be room numbered around 07, 08, and so on.\nIt did have a very generous sized bedroom with a King bed with a very comfortable mattress. Plenty of hanging provision and drawers for clothing. In a cupboard was a coded safe, ironing board (with iron) and more hanging space for jackets. It also has a kitchenette, with a sofa (with fold out bed), desk and very small dining table.\nHowever, as we were staying with friends who were also in another King room in 602, these corner rooms (01) had a better floor plan than the room next door. \nOur children slept in the fold out bed, it did obviously decrease the floor space in the room, when out, but there was still plenty of room to get around.\nThe kitchenette, has a microwave, four burner cook top including oven, sink, and decent sized fridge. Enough bowls, plates etc, for four. Enough cupboard space. Has a kettle, toaster and cutlery. You can cook in this space if needed. There was no detergent, cleaning implements etc - housekeeping will wash your dishes for you when they make up the room in the morning. You could buy this stuff if you wanted to.\nThere is no pool at this property.\nProperty location is near W74th Street on Broadway. It is about two blocks away from Central Park. (Dakota building is nearby).\nThe property is either an express subway ride to 42nd street (Times Square) or a about a 5 stop travel. Easy to navigate. Staff at the respective subway areas very helpful.\nOverall I found the property to be a bit far out of the epicentre of all the attractions downtown, but it is not that much of a detraction.\nStaff at the property extremely nice and helpful. \nNearby to the propery is (as other reviews have outlined) a market across the road, which has all of your shopping needs. Next door is a cafe, which does very nice meals and there are an abundance of other restaurant options nearby to satsify all needs. \nThe Beacon Theatre is next door and there are plenty of shows that play here that may be of interest to people. Not stage shows. When we were here, Seal was an upcoming act.\nWe booked this property on booking.com. We had no issues using this site for the property. However, although booking.com outlines the online price does not include taxes (having used it before I was aware of this) but the local taxes for property in NYC is astronomical. \nOur tarriff with booking.com was $365 per night (reasonable for NYC with the ammenties and location we were told), however when checking out, we had in excess of $300 added in NYC tax, NY State tax and local tax. When I inquired about this, I was informed it applies to all properties in NYC. \nSo kow what the full price is and budget accordingly.\nOverall a great stay.", "author": {"username": "vanders92", "num_cities": 8, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 14, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "B36EB66EC2D2EC358D460C47EB9FA459", "location": "Melbourne, Australia"}, "date_stayed": "June 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "June 25, 2012", "id": 132766920, "via_mobile": false}

We were not disappointed.\nAll the positives the other reviewers have said were spot on. We were in a one bedroom suite, which was very spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the aircon worked just fine.\nLocation was excellent for us, the subway on72nd street was just several minutes walk and we were able to get around to all the places we wanted to go - Macy's, Bloomingdales, Times Square, Ellis Island, Greenwich Village, Century 21, Tiffany's, Top of the Rock, Empire State Building, etc. However, just a tip - if you have not been to New York before, I recommend familiarising yourself with the subway network on the internet before you go as we found there were no maps available at the stations like there are in the UK. I printed off some maps before our trip and found them very helpful while we were there!\nWe ate at the Cafe Viand next door a few times - we had breakfast and dinner there. Everything we ate was lovely. There were 6 of us in our group and no one had a bad experience with food. The portions were quite large too so good value for money. Fairway supermarket across the road was fantastic. Everything you need could be found in there. We especially loved the hot meals you could buy in take away boxes. They charged per pound (I think it was $6.99 per pound) and that was enough for a meal or two! They had good selection of meat, fish, vegetables, rice and potatoes with different varieties presented each day. All of good quality, very tasty and saved us quite a bit of money. It was also very convenient, especially as we had a small kitchenette and dining area where we could eat our take away back at the hotel. They also catered for those with food allergies, stocking many wheat, gluten and dairy free items.\nCentral park was within walking distance and we decided to take a short ride in a horse and carriage on our last day. Central park is huge though so if you want to explore it properly you will need a few hours. We visited the American Museum of Natural History, which also was within walking distance of the hotel. We spent a couple of hours here but it wasn't really enough to get to see everything - it's massive!\nAll in all our first trip to New York was brilliant.

The biggest problem we faced was finding a hotel within budget that also had good reviews. I was really worried about booking my Mum and Dad into a hotel with a broken lift, vermin or lumpy beds. Our travel agent was not much help, and all our friends and family who had been to New York had bigger pockets than us! So we turned to Trip Advisor and went down the list of the highest rated Manhattan hotels until we found one, at #17 from the top, we could afford. What a good strategy that turned out to be!\nIn our fantasy holiday, we wanted to rent an apartment with two rooms, so that we would be able to eat-in. This being New York we could not find anywhere within our budget, however, with the Hotel Beacon there was no need to compromise. The little kitchenettes, with coffee makers, fridge and hob provide just enough facilities without losing the hotel feel. An added advantage was that both couples had their own bathroom!\nOur room had small kitchen and bathroom, but lots of wardrobe space and a view over noisy Broadway. My parents got a much bigger kitchen and bathroom but no view, just a much more quiet street at the side. Not sure if this was just a coincidence but it suited us all very well! Apparently floors higher up have great views over the Hudson, so ask.\nOur room was very peaceful, I now want to paint my bedroom green! Unbeknown to me, I was in the early weeks of pregnancy at the time of my stay, and after a day walking around the large, comfy bed seemed like heaven!\nThe hotel staff were very friendly. The communal areas clean and in the same Art Deco style as the rooms.\nWe wandered up and down Broadway. The location is just perfect: close to the subway, the park and the sights -but not too close!

I have never seen it mentioned but there is a great frozen yogurt place 2 minutes from the hotel (cnr 75th and Amsterdam Ave) called 16 Handles, we loved it!! \n#2. Check out the cosy pizza place Patsy's Pizzas (cnr 74th and Columbus Ave) great affordable meals!\n#3. If you visit the 9/11 Memorial book your visit online!! The Beacon will print the tix for free. The queues are enormous even if you have booked (security etc) but if you haven't booked, it's simply undo-able! We had to go back the next day.", "author": {"username": "mhclm", "num_cities": 12, "num_helpful_votes": 18, "num_reviews": 25, "num_type_reviews": 9, "id": "855A9AF93E09D504FE4ECD7E8D7D2C10", "location": "Australia"}, "date_stayed": "April 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "April 16, 2012", "id": 128027367, "via_mobile": false}

The location was amazing, walking distance to all our needs including Central Park & the subway, and a decent cab ride to & fro LGA. \nThe staff at the Beacon were very warm and accommodating from the get-go, and were happy & smiling throughout the weekend. Our one bedroom suite on the 9th floor was large and clean (a perfect one-bedroom apartment) and for the size/value/location, was reasonably priced. I loved that there are permanent residents in this hotel (my only wish that it was me!). The sofa bed mattress - from all accounts -- was a bit uncomfortable, however, though I'm sure if we had thought to call the front desk, they would have gladly fixed this up for us. Anyway, our friends took the hit, as it was my birthday, and my husband & I got the bedroom!\nAs for area food, dinner before our show at Cafe Viand was quick & easy, had some good laughs & great breakfasts at Utopia (Amsterdam & 73rd), popped in to the Dive Bar on 75th for some locally brewed beer, & found some awesome pizza by the slice at some subterranian pizzeria around the corner from hotel (where we caught a glimpse of Gregg Allman leaving the Theatre after the second night's show). Popped into the Fairway market on Sunday morning, amidst the locals doing their orders, wishing we had an extra few days' stay.

Great idea as it was an excellent choice. Staff were courteous, friendly and helpful. Hotel is clean and well decorated with a nod to Art Deco style. The rooms were spacious and comfortable with good American style tubs and shower over, fully marble tiled, amazing beds and very well equipped kitchenettes, with crockery, cutlery etc for the number of occupants. The photographs on the web site were very accurate (a rare thing on hotel websites I find) and if anything didn't do the rooms justice in terms of space and comfort. Complimentary tea bags and coffee pods for the coffee machine were provided each day As the hotel is right across the street from the incredible Fairway market, which is open 6 am till 1 am., we made full use of the catering facilities. Also there is a fast cheap clean launderette on site on the 7th floor and free use of computers printers and internet in a room off the lobby. Don't be fooled by the hotel's three star rating as this is probably down to the fact that it has no restaurant, bar or pool. This is a plus in that it is quiet, but also not a disadvantage because of the aforementioned Fairway, and also Cafe Viand downstairs which is a real New York neighbourhood diner and will even do roomservice to the Beacon if asked. It is a great safe neighbourhood to walk about in with lots of great bars and restaurants, a subway station with both express and local trains, within walking distance of Central Park, and with some iconic New York buildings nearby. The Ansonia is across the street, and on the corner of the next block is the Apple Bank, which is an old New York savings bank and worth a look inside for the amazing unspoilt decor. We had a great time on our first visit to New York, and many memorable experiences, but made all the better by being able to come \"home\" to our hotel each evening.

The staff at the front desk were very helpful upon check in & after cheekily asking if we could be upgraded & unfortunately being told the hotel was full, the wonderful receptionist said if we were willing to wait a little while, they could put us in a king room on the 25th (top!) floor! WOW!! we could not have been more amazed! The room was beautiful - HUGE & had an amazing view out over the Hudson & into NJ. My sister & her family stayed in a room on the 15th floor & their view was towards Central Park & again it was just as great! The bed was dreamy - so comfortable & gigantic. Very very clean. The room has a little kitchenette - which to be honest, we only really used the fridge from. We wanted to eat out as that's one of the things we came to the US to do :) but it was very useful for my 18 month old nephew who needed feeding more often & the microwave & cooker were a godsend. \nAwesome location, as has already been stated in previous reviews, Fairway across the street - is an adorable Aladdin's cave of a market, go there even if it is just for a wander. Subway is super close & only takes about 35-40 mins to walk to Times Square. Cabs from mid town back to the hotel are cheap so don't worry about just grabbing them.Gigi cafe, on Broadway between 71st & 72nd was a fabulous cafe we found for breakfast & we enjoyed it so much that we ordered breakfast to be delivered to the hotel on the morning of the wedding!\nFeels like you are staying in 'real' NY rather than a tourist area & there are so many shops etc in close proximity that you cannot ask for more.\nWe will definitely stay here again & would recommend staying here to everyone who is looking for a good priced, comfortable, clean, well located hotel in Manhattan.", "author": {"username": "laura g", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "id": "4F02770F246F2C4EDDB55B63472B686E"}, "date_stayed": "December 2011", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "February 19, 2012", "id": 124805701, "via_mobile": false}

There is a very good supermarket directly across the road (Fairway market) which has pretty much anything you might need as well as the Wholefoods in Columbus Circle!!!\nKen, the concierge was amazingly friendly and helpful. Jennifer on reception was a delight. We had a king suite ($305 plus taxes) and a one bedroom suite ($245 plus taxes) per night. We stayed for ten nights. Both rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced well each day. We experienced the smell of \"weed\" as mentioned in other reviews and when we mentioned it to the manager the issue was never discussed with us again. Our friends on another floor with two small children, one asthmatic complained and had their room upgraded to the ninth floor. \nOur family had two rooms on the 24th floor. We had a leak in the bathroom ceiling on our last day. When you sat on the toilet the water dripped on you. It appeared to have been patched prior to our stay as there was a big bubble in the ceiling.\nHaving the kitchen was useful as we had a small child so being able to have snacks and simple meals for him during our ten night stay was great. \nThe hotel provides excellent advice on restaurants and we endorse their recommendation of Patsy's Pizza. Just delicious. \nOur only complaint, and it is a major one is that the hotel took an additional authorisation on our Travel card unnecessarily. It took many phone calls, emails and faxes to have the problem resolved. Unfortunately the hotel kept telling us the bank was at fault and we needed to tell the bank to release the money. Both our bank and subsequent hotel in Boston explained this would not be the case otherwise any travel-card holder could phone the bank and ask for authorisations to be removed. By holding this $800 unnecessarily, we needed to purchase additional US dollars to enable us to complete our holiday. We found them extremely unhelpful in resolving this issue until the manager became involved. Finally when the authorisation was released, they refunded the cost of one room for one night ($288) in compensation. \nUntil this point our stay had been excellent but this resulted in the loss of many hours of valuable time in Boston trying to resolve this issue and left us feeling our integrity had been questioned.

We stayed from 29 Dec 2011 until 3 Jan 2012.\nUpon check in I asked for a room as high as possible to make the most of the view and the guy on the reception moved us from the 6th to the 17th floor which gave us a lovely view over the rooftops to the front of the hotel over Broadway.\nAll of the reception staff and the man on the door were always very polite and helpful with all of our questions.\nThe room was extremely clean, housekeeping came everyday and will change your towels daily if you wish so. I used the hairdryer in the bathroom which was fine, just not too powerful. The shampoo bottles and soap etc were replaced daily even if they werent used so we had q bit of a stock of them by the time we left!\nThe bed was huge and so comfortable, we both got great nights sleep. We turned the air con off in the room as it seemed to go quite cold even with us adjusting it and the natural temp was fine.\nOne thing we did find was that the housekeeping did sometimes come around 8.30am which was slightly early for us so the do not disturb sign came in handy for this!!\nThe kitchenette was a great idea as we got some bagels from the Fairway supermarket over the road and had a relaxed wake up in the room before a crazy day out in the city.\nThe phonecard from reception worked out as great value for money. We bought one for ten dollars and this gave us 5 hours of call time to uk landlines!!! More than we needed but definately the cheapest option compared to using our mobiles or standing in the sub-zdero temperatures outside!\nThe location is good with Central Park just two blocks walk away. The walk from the hotel down to Times Square took approx 35-40 mins but costs just 10 dollars in a cab with tip so we used them to get back after a long day of sight seeing and shopping. The subway is on 72nd street so again, worth using this to go downtown etc.\nWe would stay here again, it really is a lovely hotel.", "author": {"username": "Onreek", "num_cities": 6, "num_helpful_votes": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "num_type_reviews": 5, "id": "1DD221F004E667C3EE1946612C8E3D9F", "location": "Plymouth, England"}, "date_stayed": "December 2011", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "January 8, 2012", "id": 122779527, "via_mobile": false}

However, the staff were efficient and courteous. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite ($300 per night) overlooking Broadway. It was a nice view of the street and we could not hear any street noise. The room was clean, spacious and in good condition. It had a kitchenette which was very useful. There is a very good supermarket directly across the road (Fairway market) which has pretty much anything you might need.\nThis part of Manhattan is great. It is very safe and people are friendly. Although there are tourists around, there are also many locals going about their daily business. There are lots of restaurants and cafes within walking distance. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there is a 24 hour cafe next door. It is easy to catch the subway to anywhere you want to go in Manhattan and it doesn't take long to get anywhere.\nMy only problem with the hotel was the Internet room. The Internet room is next to the lobby. Internet was free but the room only has 2 computers and it is tiny. Because there is sometimes high demand, people are meant to use it for 30 minutes only if anyone is waiting. If you want to use the Internet, bear this in mind. Otherwise, it is a very good hotel.

We were not disappointed! \nWe found the Trip Advisor reviews to be accurate and fair. We booked a one bedroom suite (Room 1802) to share between four adults (all in our mid to late 20s - a married couple and two friends), which comfortably provided all of us with heaps of space and privacy. As reflected in the earlier reviews, the bathroom was small, but very clean and had very (!) strong water pressure. The room was very clean and fairly recently refurbished (we requested a newly refurbished room on an upper floor overlooking Broadway and our request was met). There was heaps of closet space and the kitchenette was ideal. As others have mentioned, the in-room wi-fi was quite expensive, so we didn't pay to have it. However, with a Starbucks literally on every other corner offering free wi-fi and a few computers in the Lobby with free wi-fi, we don't think we would have used it even if we had of purchased it.\nIn our view, the hotel is perfectly located on the corner of 75th and Broadway on the Upper West Side. It is a great neighbourhood which while quieter than Midtown or Downtown (which is exactly what we were after \u2013 we all agreed that we would have hated to have stayed anywhere near the crush of Times Square!) still had loads of cafes, restaurants and shopping all within walking distance (we recommend Big Nick\u2019s Burgers on Broadway one block up from the hotel, Blondies Sports Bar, Red Velvet cupcakes on 72nd Street and the Wine Bar on 72nd Street after Columbus). As other reviews have mentioned, there are two fantastic grocer / deli / supermarkets directly across the road, which we made full use of! We felt like true New Yorkers by the end of our trip!\nI am a single female traveller and I felt completely safe walking around the neighbourhood by myself at night as well as catching the subway by myself to our stop at night (the Red 1, 2 and 3 lines all go Down Town to the main attractions and all stop at 72nd street, so it was really easy to get around \u2013 get the unlimited pass if you are there for a week, we found it was great value). \nThe staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly for NYC. The fold out mattress in the sofa was very uncomfortable on our first night, so we asked for an upgrade the next morning. While they didn\u2019t have any upgrade rooms available during our stay, they did replace the WHOLE couch for us so that we got a better foldout mattress, which was very impressive! (The replacement couch still wasn\u2019t ideal, but it wasn\u2019t an issue for us. Our tip is that if you are a fussy sleeper and can afford it, opt for the two bedroom suite or dual queen bed suite if you don\u2019t require as much privacy).\nAll in all, we had a fantastic stay at Hotel Beacon and will definitely be recommending it to our family and friends.

The best customer service I've received in years, the male staff held the door open for me every single time I exited and the women were courteous and kind and wonderful. \nThe room I stayed in was clean and theres an AC remote in every room for you to tailor the temperature to your liking which was a godsend for me because I am not a fan of frigid air conditioned rooms so I could turn it off without a big production. I liked the art deco theme of my room and the hotel lobby. The cleaning lady was so amazing , when she cleaned my room it would literally sparkle after I returned ... no half assed cleaning. That impressed me because it demonstrates such a high commitment to your job, which I value and appreciate. \nThe beach is across the street and the Beacon provided lounge chairs and large beach towels which were great, I would grab them and head to the most gorgeous sand beach and sun. Beautiful. \nThe Beacon is right on Ocean drive so there are dozens and dozens of restaurants right outside your door and there is a Walgreens right on Fifth street, two blocks from the hotel. Walgreens is a great resource so keep the location on notepad or something because it was the only place to get some fruit, sunglasses, ear plugs, a hat because I forgot mine at home and about everything else you would need. \nNo place is perfect so here are a few things that you might need to consider before making your final choice:\nThe elevator - it stopped working a couple of times and it is very, very small and very, very busy so you could be waiting for an elevator for several minutes. I just took the stairs and did not mind doing that at all but I did notice some older patrons who had canes and walkers and had trouble with the stairs etc. If you health or physical issues that prevent taking the stairs then I'm not sure if these older (albeit gorgeous) hotels are the best fit for you and your vacation.\nThe noise - The Beacon is right on the main drag and it's very, very noisy (thus the ear plugs from Walgreens!) until around 2 in the morning.\nThe last cab - The day of my departure the front desk called some sort of airport van for my transportation (I requested a taxi and this is what they ordered) and the driver over charged me, tipped himself $5 and then didn't have enough change on him to break a ten dollar bill which meant he further padded his cost. This royally pissed me off because I felt scammed and it was the hotel who arranged this Cuban clown cabbie so, I would warn you against this experience because it left a bad taste in my mouth at the end of my trip. But tipping is a big scam in SoBe, more on this later. \nFood in South Beach - Is horrible. There is simply no other way for me to put it. I got sick and ill from eating at the restaurants because they drown, douse and marinate everything in a lard they refer to as Cuban Criolla Butter, which is just another term for lard. It was repulsive, disgusting, vile. It made me sick. I tried dozens of places and they all cooked with the same ingredients. Absolutely horrid food culture. It's LARD central. I limited myself to one meal a day at the end of the day so that I could just be in my hotel when I got sick because there was no where within 20 minutes drive or 1 hour walk that did not include this disgusting lard. \nTipping - This was by far the most insulting and infuriating part of being in South Beach. The tipping and gratuity applications are a BIG SCAM, so beware! It's set up so you over tip and wont realize until it's too late. The waiters would bring out the bill at the end of our meal and then run our credit cards and come back with an entirely different amount and it would literally take several minutes to figure out what the hell they were charging and how much because it's all in the fine print! We finally figured out after you give consent to run your credit card, they tack on a gratuity of anywhere between 15 -25%. BEWARE!!! If you're not paying attention you will end up tipping 30% without realizing it. \nService in Restaurants - In South Beach is terrible. It's all terrible. No details needed because you will get bad service most of the time and then bad food and then scammed at the end! Not good.\nLanguage - Now I happen to love the Latin culture and love the Spanish language, it's one of the reasons I chose Miami South Beach for a vacation but it did get frustrating finding people who spoke no English. I'm not making a political statement or being a bigot as I am foreign myself and look Latin ... Just saying it got irritating after a few days of few English Speakers. Try to be prepared. \nI saved the WORST for last:\nThe Place - That is name of the disgusting, horrid restaurant in the hotel Beacon. I will limit this to a few choice words otherwise it will turn into a rant! lol Food is particularly disgusting at The Place. Staff & service was hostile, disrespectful and malicious. No one spoke English. Stay away from this horrid establishment. Your first time there will be your last, I can guarantee it. \nThe Beacon is a great hotel with wonderful staff who will go out of their way to make you comfortable and happy and the staff is pleasant and sweet. \nMy last morning at the hotel I spilled a full cup of scalding hot coffee on myself and all over the floor ... ouch! So, I may have uttered a few expletives. I was embarrassed and in pain from where the coffee landed and the management waited until I turned to leave before one of the cleaning ladies discreetly moved in and clean up the mess made. They did not make a fuss and they went out of their way to not embarrass me further, it meant the world to me. \nYou will love this hotel.", "author": {"username": "R T", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "Toronto, Canada", "id": "B285FA3AE1ADD9271E3022B3BDA1AAF0"}, "date_stayed": "November 2011", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 15, 2011", "id": 121767181, "via_mobile": false}

If you stay at this hotel make sure you go to Viand - the little cafe / diner next door. The staff there are fantastic and so helpful with recommendations of places to go etc. They have great value and tasty food with a really nice 'American family diner' type atmosphere. Some of our fondest memories of New York are from having a meal in the Viand Cafe late at night and having a chat to the owner and one of their waiters John who is such a great character!

There is also a laundromat in the hotel which is great for when you are travelling. The only issue we had, was that we were given a room with a double bed, when it was supposed to be a King sized bed. Our friend's room booked at the same time as ours and was for the same - 1 bedroom suite with a King bed and theirs did in fact have a King bed so we enquired with reception.

Normally hotels that run in the low $200 range in New York City are not the kinds of places you want to spend a lot of time or in the best of areas. The Beacon is surely the exception!\nWe arrived via subway - the hotel is about a half-block north of the 72nd street station on the 1-2-3 line. Check-in was swift and efficient and we were able to get a room on the next to top floor. Given the small size of the lobby we were expecting an equally small room. We were very surprised to find a very well apportioned room with lots of amenities: large bed, separate closet, kitchenette with microwave, sink, coffee maker, stove top and refridge. The bathroom was clean and came with a nice assortment of toiletries. Another plus: both the hotel and the location was QUIET - sometimes a hard thing to find in NYC.\nAcross the street is the flagship Fairway Market which is open from 6:00 AM to 1:00 AM. Here you can get an amazing assortment of just about anything - great to stock the refridge in the room (and to take back home with you). There is a caf\u00e9 in the Fairway where we ate breakfast each day: fresh and organic food.\nI've not spent much time in the upper west side; within blocks of the hotel we found numerous restaurants and assorted shops. And unlike other places in NYC we didn't feel uncomfortable walking around at midnight in this neighbourhood. Given the close proximity to the subway and location on Broadway would highly recommend this hotel even for activities located elsewhere in the city.

The Fairways Market, directly across from the hotel, is an obvious choice, but do wander around. I personally love the West Side Market just a few blocks up from the Hotel (between 76th and 77th). I think they have more options if you want to have dinner in your hotel room.\nBeds: The beds are amazing. The King bed is huge and could fit 3 people in there (hey, watch it! I wasn't going there!)\nKitchenette: Has all you need; plates, cups, bowls, cutlery, toaster, kettle, microwave, fridge (with freezer), gas hob, and a coffee making machine (with lovely French Roast Coffee!)\nCable TV: I know, you didn't come to New York to watch TV but it's nice to have a choice when you do want to laze a little!\nBeacon Theatre next door.

At least give people basic Wifi free of charge and if they want a faster connection, then they pay. In this day and age and with how good free Wifi has become in New York it's wrong that the Hotel still charges. Yes, you have the business centre but there is always somebody in there!

It is 9 dollars a day which is a lot seeing as visitors are not in the hotel much.They do however have a free internet room which was great..All Starbucks and Mc Donalds have free Wi Fi so anyone can make use of that.\n We loved New York.We went on a helicopter ride !

Maybe. \nThe hotel is conveniently located at W 75 street at Broadway.

It had a nice living room, and a kitchen area . As regards to the kitchen area I must say that it was poorly equipped. No dishwasher and no brushes for doing the dishes, very little equipment for making food.\nThe suite also had two bathrooms. Especially one of them was stone cold! We had to cover the floor with towels to prevent us from freezing our toes of. There was a hot air fan but it made a lot of noise in addition to making the room way to hot. So in fact we had to choose from either freezing or listening to a noise fan transforming the room to a sauna. \nThe bed was ok, but I absolutely hate the american kind of bed cover instead of a european duvet. \nThe air-condition on the bedroom was also a kind of schizophrenic as it was almost impossible to produce a steady temperature in the room. \nThere was no breakfast at the hotel. \nAll in all I would say that hotel Beacon is a ok hotel.

The lobby, while small, is modern and attractive, as is the surrounding neighborhood. We enjoyed the convenience of the Fairway Market across the street, Zabar's Deli was a few blocks north, there were lots of reasonable priced restaurants on Amsterdam Avenue, the 72 St subway stop was a short walk away, where we caught an express train to 42St, Lincoln Centre is only an interesting 10 or 15 minute walk, Columbus Circle and the Times Warner building not much further, Central Park a few blocks walk, American Museum of Natural History too. The Beacon Theatre is literally next door, it's a beautiful venue with top music performers. We saw Gillian Welch there, the billboard showed Steely Dan I think, and Bryan Ferry and Sting among others. Ask for a higher floor, looks like some lower ones on the back side could face into a brick wall? Concierge recommended Aroma Espresso Bar on 72 St. for our non-Starbucks experience. Good choice.

Having missed our connecting flight from LA due to delays in the customs lines, we arrived at the Beacon at 2am exhausted and frustrated after almost 30 hours of travelling from Australia. What a relief to be checked in quickly and efficiently into our one bedroom corner suite on the 24th floor! It really felt like our own apartment rather than a hotel room. Great views, excellent housekeeping, very clean. The bathroom was a little small but other than that the rooms were a very good size, particularly the lounge and dining areas. There was a 24 hour laundry on level 7 and for $10 in quarters, you can do two loads of washing and drying (this includes washing powder, etc). Coins can be obtained from reception. This was very handy for us as we have two young boys. There are several eateries nearby which deliver to the hotel, so even though there is no room service, you can still enjoy this option. We didn't enjoy the diner next door but the hotel staff did recommend a couple of other places nearby which were good. Across the road there are two delis/markets, with a number of others a block away also. We found Citarella much better than Fairways in terms of quality, although it does close earlier in the evening. After a long day of walking and site seeing, you can purchase a roast chicken, mash potatoes and vegetables/salads from Citarella and enjoy them in your room...a great option. Another benefit is the 1, 2, 3 subway stop just a two minute walk from the hotel, which pretty much gets you to anywhere you need to go in the city. Basically, you are three stops away from Times Square. Central Park is a short walk away and the neighborhood itself is lovely. We can say that for 10 days we lived 10 minutes walking distance away from Yoko Ono :-) Make sure you visit the Levain Bakery on 74th for some lovely treats and a coffee.", "author": {"username": "GeorgiaC2011", "num_cities": 4, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "num_reviews": 5, "location": "Melbourne, Australia", "id": "AEFCE817B4E434C49862BFA2A14519B1"}, "date_stayed": "October 2011", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "date": "October 16, 2011", "id": 119373402, "via_mobile": false}

This hotel offered the most space I could find without paying for a \"suite\" . Our room consisted of two bedrooms, two bathrooms (great for families), a full kitchen and a living room. This was unbelievably priced at about $500. Cheap by no means, but any other comparable amount of space in the city would be well into $1,000s. \nThe room was kept clean and well decorated in pastel/green colors. There were nice-sized closets so bags were not laying on the floor. Big windows in each room, however we were not high enough to get a view of the city (Room 906). But a decent view of the activity on Broadway below could be seen. Each room had a flat-panel TV and there was one more TV in the living room (no fights over what to watch). Beds were comfortable with nice comforters sheets which seemed new. Having multiple bathrooms saved us plenty of time getting two kids under 10 ready for the day or ready for bed. One of the bathrooms had a tub, the other had a walk-in shower. We did have a problem with the A/C going out one night - we were there when it was 102, so that didn't score positive points with us. However it was fixed quickly and the maintenance person had a friendly attitude. In fact, all staff we came into contact with (doormen, housekeeping) had good attitudes and seemed happy to be there.\nThe location was great for families - no hassles or large crowds associated with Mid-town but not \"dead\" either. There are two markets directly across the street which we visited for food to take advantage of the kitchen. If you choose not to cook there are plenty of other restaurant options in the immediate area. Another reason I liked this hotel was there was a subway station a short block down the street which connected us to Midtown/Times Sq in minutes. \nMy biggest complaint was the daily internet cost - In this age I feel internet should be complimentary.

Checkin and checkout was pleasant and quick. We were so surprised to find that we were in a 2xqueen bed suite (room #809) that over- looked Broadway (the suite's windows were double glazed so the street noise was no concern). Lots of fellow Australians use this hotel. The lifts were fast to arrive. There was a combined lounge/dining area with a nice sized TV. The beds were comfy (though the air con in our bedroom was quite noisey) and the kitchenette was a bonus (fridge/oven/microwave/toaster/coffee maker and a tiny sink but who wants to prepare a full meal - this is holiday time!) The Fairway Market is just across the road and it is a Pandora's Box of goodies, all to save you the trouble of preparing foods (just pick from their vast array of hot or cold takeaway foods) QUIRKY TIP: We had bananas for 79cents a pound (they are sooo expensive currently in Australia!!) The suite's bathroom was small and always clean, as was the suite and in fact the whole Hotel.... Great staff - congrats to the Management! Our local subway was on 72nd Street at Broadway and also here was a small, well kept garden/park - great for people watching when you weren't rushing around this massive city. Lots of eateries serving differing foods for all budgets are closeby and it is in a friendly and safe area. An added bonus for the traveller is their 7th floor laundry (coin operated and open 24hrs a day!) Also available are 3 public phones on the 2nd floor - just buy a Calling Card and home in Australia is just a phonecall away! There is a large CVS Pharmacy a few blocks north on Broadway.

I'll try to provide some details that might help.\nFirst, as you probably know, the hotel is 3 blocks to Central Park and about the same distance to the Am. Museum of Nat'l HIstory. There is a subway station a block away at pretty Verdi Square at 72d & Broadway. Next to the station is a Trader Joe's and Gray's Papaya. The station serves the lines to Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle and Times Square. Broadway at this point is a divided street with a median of trees and flowerbeds. Across the street are two markets. Next door is a wine store and a cafe. On the corner is a Stabucks. \nBroadway is lined with beautiful residential buildings around the Beacon, and there is a good mix of commerce (a Barney's), markets, theaters, and restaurants. We walked Broadway from the Beacon in the uptown direction as far as 83rd (Artie's Delicatessen) and \"downtown\" to 71st (a beautiful Gothic church). We walked to Columbus Ave. (Isabella's and the museum, both at 77th) via 75th (brownstones) and to the Dakota & another subway (serving a different line to Rockefeller Center) via 72d (shops). It wasn't unusual to see a cab waiting in front of the hotel.\nFrom some descriptions I expected a small lobby and an understaffed staff. The lobby is small but very comfortable and was often used by guests to meet up with their families or to wait for a cab. Even at our very late check in, there were at least two, very friendly, very professional front desk clerks. There was no concierge, per se, but a \"customer services\" desk. Housekeeping and maintenance were equally responsive and gracious. We loved our doorman. On the day it rained, he gave us umbrellas. There are three small, quick elevators in the lobby, \nWe had a one bedroom suite. The room is done in a soft, pleasant green palette, with simple-designed furniture. Even the art is tasteful by many hotel standards. In our suite, there was a large closet at the entry, with a large flat safe that you could use with your own pin (number). The living area and the bedroom had separate, efficient climate zones.\nThe kitchenette included a sink, a microwave, an apartment refrigerator, a stove, and an electric coffee pot. We didn't ever use the stove or coffee pot. There's only a couple of pots and pans, a cutting board, some utensils, and a set of dishes, flatware, and glasses for four. I found out later that there is a little sign inside the cabinet that tells you that you can ask for more, including wine glasses and a sharp knife. Our little sinkful of dirty dishes was washed for us during the maid service. \nThere is desk near the kitchenette, another large closet in the bedroom, and lots of drawer space. Two televisions (with lots of cable choices), an ipod dock, and three phones. Ours was a very nice queen bed. The sofa bed in the living room didn't look like much but was surprisingly comfortable. \nThe bathroom is small but very pleasant. A large frosted window opens from the top, allowing air and the sounds of the city. The sill is wide enough for your personal items, as there is no vanity. The bedroom and the living room each had tall windows. The living room sill was especially wide. \nWe learned that the upper floors had good views. Our was on the 23rd floor, with views toward Central Park and over to Midtown. There were no close buildings obstructing our view. \nI first learned about this hotel from asking questions on tripadvisor, but came to learn that it is recommended by many other sources as one of the best values for families in the city. The recommendations here came from both NYC experts and people who visited from other countries. Indeed, when we were there it seemed that there were many families staying there and we heard several different languages spoken. I booked online almost 3 months in advance and got their internet special rate. If you've looked at their reservation site, you know what the rate is. My understanding from my reading is that it is the same rate year-round. I believe this is considered moderate in New York City, and I considered it a value only when I remembered (1) it was for four people, with room and (2) it was on the Upper West Side, away from (but very close to) Times Square. After making the reservation, I emailed the hotel about special requests for floor with view, late check-in, and no smoking (which I hadn't made at the time of the reservation) and I got a response within 24 hours acknowledging my requests.\nOur stay was wonderful. We relied on the subway quite a bit. We got a week's pass our first day. The trains run frequently, which is good because you get to your destination quickly and because it can get pretty hot down there waiting. 72d is a good station because all the lines it serves stop there and it is right next to the hotel. I carried a map on our outings which had the official MTA map on it. I never felt unsafe on the streets or on the subway.", "author": {"username": "bleicherblog", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 25, "num_reviews": 27, "location": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "id": "648B26D8F5CB5F94D95CC5205C2FDA25"}, "date_stayed": "July 2011", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 11, "date": "August 9, 2011", "id": 116490221, "via_mobile": false}

I had travelled here twice before and always in winter and stayed very centrally. This time we wanted to be out of the centre in order to be able to stroll around easily and enjoy areas more frequented by New Yorkers. We chose the Hotel Beacon because of the area (upper west side) and reviews on Trip Advisor. We could not have been happier!! The hotel is star rated lower because there is no restaurant or bar onsite. The rooms are certainly worthy of at least a 4* rating. We had a superior room with a kingsize bed, small (but perfectly formed) kitchenette, bathroom with bath. The room also had a small seating area with coffee table and two chairs, a desk and spectacular views. The hotel staff were smart, friendly and helpful, the concierge provided us with a really useful map and there was a folder in the room with suggestions and recommendations for local restaurants and other local venues - if you travel here look in this early on - it really is useful. Our room was kept spotless and they ask how often you wish your bedding changed in order to remain as green as possible - so it really is your choice.\nLocally we found a fantastic market selling everything opposite, don't miss the wonderful cafe upstairs! There is a recommended diner/restaurant next door, but we did not try this - too many other options. Our favourite was a sushi/asian cuisine restaurant just around the block on Amsterdam Avenue, so good we ate there 3 times in 8 days! Cannot recommend any one dish as they were all superb - sit outside to get a feel for the real New York. Also further up the road don't miss 16 Handles the frozen yoghurt place - the flavours change regularly - we found it after watching literally tens of new yorkers wandering by with tubs in their hands! Also further up we feel Fred's deserves a mention great food, very friendly and again you can sit outside and watch the world go by. \nWith the advantage of a fridge in the room we did a little food (and wine) shopping so that on two occasions when we had walked our feet off and could not manage to get back, bath and redress to go out again, we curled up in the armchairs and enjoyed a light meal in our room. Wine-wise there is a fantastic off license just two doors down from the hotel, fantastic selection and lots of information about the wines. Our regret was we missed out on tickets at the Beacon Theatre - literally next door. Check out the website as this is the most convenient venue in New York for this hotel! \nOnly one small down point to mention, wifi is available but at a cost of $9.99 per day - yes there is a Starbucks two doors down but that is not much use if you are planning your day last thing at night before bed! It would be nicer if the hotel would consider a one off charge - we stayed 8 days and paid for two lots of 24 hours. The service is available so either a maximum download or no charge at all would have been preferable rather than a daily charge.\nHowever despite that small moan - We love this area and will, most definitely return.

I had looked at a lot of hotels for our trip but the high cost of rooms at this time of year narrowed our choice somewhat. The Beacon was a bargain compared to many others. Our spacious room had two double beds, a small kitchen area, spotlessly clean bathroom and a great view. We ate breakfast in the room a few times - just cereal and toast but the kitchen was more than adequate and a great way of keeping your costs down. The hotel is a block away from the subway but you can walk to Times Square etc in around 30-40 minutes. It is also just a few blocks away from Central Park which has to be one of my favourite places - great for people and dog watching. Although The Beacon doesn't have any restaurant / bar facilities there are plenty to choose from right on the doorstep. One of our favourites was http://www.goodenoughtoeat.com/ - try the strawberry butter - amazing! The Fairway market directly opposite the hotel also has a great cafe upstairs as well as a fantastic choice of foodstuffs - my partner was very impressed by the choice of cereals and pop tarts! but they also do some great deli dishes. \nNew York in December is very, very busy but beautiful - the shops / streets are wonderfully decorated and there is a great buzz about the place. If you want to feel even more festive go to the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall - a cheesy but fantastic show. \nTry The Beacon - it's in a great location and is great value.", "author": {"username": "Ginggang", "num_cities": 4, "num_helpful_votes": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "num_type_reviews": 4, "id": "A8E80C99AE261544522959EDD14C4AFD", "location": "Glasgow"}, "date_stayed": "December 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "June 23, 2011", "id": 114675173, "via_mobile": false}

I received so many compliments from my crew saying what a GREAT pick I made. As was written in other reviews, the hotel was in a great location - within walking distance to Central Park, Riverside Park, a walkway running along the Hudson River, a subway station, stores, restaurants, a very neat and unique frozen yogurt place called 16 Handles and so much more. The rooms were large, super clean, and had kitchenettes. What really wowed us was the treatment we received upon check-in. We arrived at 9:30 am and thought we would put our name in and ask them to hold our bags. Instead, the gentleman at the counter said he had an executive suite available & would we like that at no additional cost :-). Of course we said YES and off we went to begin our great little getaway. The only minor comment I could add that is not 110% positive is that we hadn't expected the elevators to be so small. We were on the 23rd floor and were usually crammed in like sardines by the time we arrived to the lobby. The wait for the elevator was not too long though because there were 3 of them. \nWe will stay at the Hotel Beacon again and again when we go back to visit NYC.

The living room had a pull-out sofa, where my teenage daughter slept. My wife and I had complete privacy in a very nice bedroom (Marriott or Hilton standard). We paid $350/night. That was a far lower rate than two regular hotel rooms, particularly of this quality. Okay, the bathroom was no bigger than necessary -- but it was big enough. There was no restaurant or on-site breakfast... but next door there was a coffee shop, two doors down there was a Starbucks, across the street was a supermarket with a \"bistro\"-style restaurant upstairs, and we were on the Upper-West Side of Manhattan, so finding food at any time was no problem. And with the kitchen, we saved a lot of money by eating in for breakfast every day and a couple of times for dinner during our week-long stay. Great service: the room was not ready when we arrived and we had to wait 30 minutes...so the reception clerk gave us free internet access for our entire stay!

I needn't have worried.\nThe suite we were in was very spacious (huge by NYC standards!) lovely and spotlessly clean, very comfortable indeed with a massive bed and loads of storage. There were 3 wardrobes, so I could afford to have a 'wedding dress cupboard' as well as hanging up our other clothes. 2 large TVs with a full range of cable channels including movies.\nThe kitchenette was very handy and The Fairway across the road is impressive as reported by other reviewers.\nThe upper West Side location is a leafy and pleasant area and was a relief to return to after the chaos of downtown. The Park & Natural history museum are very close and we found everything we found we needed within a few blocks - pharmacy, stationers, off licence, hairdresser, nail salon to name a few. Try Arties diner on W83rd/broadway we only found it on our last day, was filled withlocals, great food.\nThe subway is very close and easy to use - just jump on the red line! It's a 5min trip to times square and beyond goes all the way downtown to staten island ferry via Greenwich village and all in-between. Very easy trip.\nThe staff were unfailing pleasant and friendly, however we learnt to to request things (eg \nextra glasses sent up/ someone to come & fix telly) twice every time as any request made was never completed first time - although they were always very positive when request made.\nThe only other slight criticisms I'd make are that the air con in our room seemed to have a loose part which jangled making it impossible to leave on at night (the one in the other room was fine though).\nAlthough there are 2 PCs available in the lobby for Internet use, WIFI in room is $10 a day. In this day & age free wifi needs to be standard. Also it says 20mins max on a PC but there was a man who seemed to be on it all day everyday, I don't even think he was a hotel guest. I wouldn't mention it, but we desperately needed to print off an important doc asap and this man informed us he would be at least another hour - some monitoring of the Internet use would have come in handy there!\nVery minor niggles in what was overall a fantastic stay.

Given that we were sightseeing and going to plays about 9 hours a day,\nwe loved having the ready-made salads, grilled veggies, poached salmon, etc. ready to go - the store is open daily from 6:00 a.m. until 1:00 a.m. We bought the New York City Pass which was a great bargain (we went to the Museum of Natural History, MOMA, the two hour boat ride (Circle Line Tour) and the Top of the Rock. There were still lots of coupons in the book, but we ran out of time. We saw Daniel Radcliff's new musical, \"How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\" at the Al Hershfield Theatre. We loved it. We also saw Ben Stiller, Edie Falco, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Mary Beth Hurt in \"The House of Blue Leaves\". The acting was superb but the girls said they wouldn't have enjoyed seeing it as much if Ben Stiller hadn't been in it. (it's a very dark comedy). Ben Stiller played the piano and sang - didn't know he could do that! The female leads were outstanding!\nThere are many stores near the hotel (wine store, LUSH, Urban Outfitters, Trader Joe's).\nThe apartment buildings near the hotel (going towards Central Park - a mere 8 minutes away) are very exclusive and beautiful. The famous Dakota is on the corner when you get out of the subway at 72nd and Central Park West.

The east/west blocks downtown are much longer - one of their blocks equal 3 north/south blocks. (this we learned on the Circle Line tour!)\nCentral Park was beauitiful - most of the blossoms were out (the magnolia trees probably bloomed completed the day after we left!). It was great having it so close to the hotel. I have stayed in Times Square before and Englewood, New Jersey. Being in the Upper West side is the best thing you can do!

There are many shops around the immediate area, such as Sephora, the Body Shop, Urban Outfitters, Filene's and a few pharmacies. There is also a Starbucks next to the hotel, which was great to use for the internet as the daily rate of 10 dollars at the hotel was too steep in our opinion.\nThere is an abundance of restaurants along Amsterdam Avenue and surrounding streets, so you have plenty of choice. We tried out an asian restaurant called 'Fusha' which is really worth a try. We would also recommend Levain bakery for delicious cookies- worth the 4 dollars each! and Freddie and Pepper's pizza place have the tastiest pizza slices we had in New York. For breakfast we would definitely recommend the Manhattan Diner, which is only 2 mins away from the hotel. It was far superior than the Viand Cafe right next to the hotel, cheaper too.

The Hotel has a laundry, making it such a good choice for families. The Hotel is extremely well situated. The market opposite was wonderful. Also. it is nice and close to 72nd St subway which was very useful, especially during the blizzard. Cinemas were close too, at the Lincoln centre which my son enjoyed during the bad weather. The Upper West Side is a great place to stay in New York. A very quick metro trip to Times square and Fifth Ave, but we were happy to be staying away from the bustle of those areas, especially at Christmas. A very pleasant walk to Central Park, which we did often. Lots of great eateries nearby. We particularly enjoyed the Thai at Land at 450 Amsterdam and you must visit Barney Greengrass for an authentic bagel experience. If you are intending to stay at the Beacon, check out their theatre next door, as they have lots going on. We have already recommended this wonderful Hotel to family and friends.

Special thank you to the doormen, who were very friendly and accommodating.\nInternet is available on site via two computers downstairs in the lobby - I waited in line several times to use it but thats understandable with the high amount of guests.

A small fridge and a microwave in each room - with a Fairway supermarket close by - was a real convenience.\nThe only \"fly in the ointment\" was the fact that the hotel charged $9.95/daily for internet access!

Stayed for 12 nights over Xmas, so we had a good deal of time there to assess just what type of\nplace this is.\nLocation adjacent, (100 metres from 72nd st metro stop) great location, this is 4 or 5 stops from times square centre of town, ie 42nd st for all theatres etc. Metro is $2.25 per ride per person regardless of distance, so get a card which you can place $ value on and then use it all over the system. Also can be used on buses. So 3 people going all over metro system per trip is really cheap. Super convenient safe clean system.\nBut the Beacon..... clean, safe, opposite fairway, i think, super market, 24/7 place with everything and anything you can imagine, also rooms are equipped with kitchenette ie micro wave, stove, fridge & sink etc . coffee making, haridryers, full bathroom including a tub king bed in main room. We got a jnr suit for a very reasonable rate but there are the following taxes applicable to all NYC hotel stays; state tax, city tax, occupancy tax and hotel unit fee so you have to factor that in to all accommodation. Sone of the rooms on our floor, 11th overlooking Broadway, are occupied/owned by fulltime residents. So i suppose it is almost like a serviced apartment block. \nThe Beacon is worth every cent, great housekeeping, polite reception even assisted when we got hit with a Blizzard in getting us onto our airline to get out of NYC to Vegas. Free internet room off foyer, we had a couple of housekeeping malfunctions, we notified hotel and literally within 5 minutes people were at our door who actually fixed the problem. The room had movies on demand if you got sick of the 100 plus channels. 24/7 security and they are able to get you tickets to shows, tours etc if you like. \nWe cant speak highly enough of this place and would not hesitate to recommend it to\nothers, regardless of age or trip reason. The hotel is 3 or 4 blocks walk from Central Park which is itself amazing, 3 or 4 blocks from Lincoln Centre which houses opera, ballet and movies etc. You can walk to 5th Ave or just down Broadway as a tourist.\nColumbus and Amsterdam are 1 or 2 blocks East of the hotel and they are crammed with restaurants. Beacon has cafe Viand in the building, didnt try it. But the supermarket opposite has a breakfast floor which is great for brekky and reasonable if you dont want to use the kitchen.\nThe prices in Midtown are substantially more for similar quality of that offered by the Beacon we had friends there asnd saw there rooms. We stayed at the Woolcott Hotel on 34th Street for 5 nights also and though nice it was not a patch on the Beacon, more expensive BUT you could walk to 42 Street and Madison Square Garden. \nTips for Beacon use the free internet, walk to metro and use it to go both downtown and also uptown to Harlem directly. Walk to Central Park, walk to the Dakota Building where tragically John LENNON was murdered and Strawberry Fields rememberance area. Get all your groceries at the supermarket opposite Beacon which also has barb B Q chooks hot off the rotisserie for lunch, which are great for sandwiches for kids and pre packed salads very reasonably priced. Walk down to Lincoln centre and checkout movies playing if you want a quiet night in. Go out the hotel turn right heard uptown cross Broadway for 2 blocks and there is Nicks Hamburger joint which has huge menu and great burgers, pasta, fries shakes etc and all reasonable, open 24/7 dinner for 3 of us @ $40. Also chilli and peppers pizza joint in street behind hotel which is really cheap and sells pie by the slice with a nice salad, dinner for 3 of us was @ $25.\nAlso if you are looking to shop, get the metro up to Harlem. There is Marshalls store there which has heaps of sport gear like Nike, Reebok, And 1, etc etc all cheap and lots of street wear shops stocking levis etc. I priced a pair of nikeair max s in midtown and Macys then went to harlem and got the same shoes for $50 USD less!!!!!!! Also at Macys take your passport in and get a discount card for 10% on all purchases. There are lots of branded clothes and shoes discounted throughout NYC, (according to my 14 year old daughter and lots of nice boutiques in Amsterdam and Columbus near Beacon), also a great flea market on Sunday on West 78 St (I think), which has great jewellery and furs etc, also vintage clothes.\nIn our opinion if you are visiting NYC and you want safe,clean,friendly and competitively priced accommodation you cant go past the Beacon Hotel.", "author": {"username": "clariceSydney", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 5, "num_type_reviews": 5, "id": "FBC04A7DCD0DB55A3A07F50C8017EF33", "location": "sydney"}, "date_stayed": "December 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "date": "January 3, 2011", "id": 91483967, "via_mobile": false}

This hotel was recommended by a friend of my sister's and it lived up to its reputation. It reminded me of a small, boutique type of hotel with more personalized service. The Beacon is located on the upper west side, a perfect location...still close to all the action, but you feel like you are in a more residential area than the hustle and bustle of being downtown. Somehow, it reminded me of Europe.\nI was in NYC to watch my niece graduate from college and so my husband and I, plus my sisters, mother and extended family all stayed at Hotel Beacon. We had a king room and my other family members had a king suites. The rooms were spacious and very clean. We had a small kitchenette which we really didn't use, but it was great to have just in case. We stayed for 5 nights and it was so comfortable that I felt like I was living there. The king suites were also very nice and spacious. The only suggestion I would make for fellow women travelers is to bring your own hair dryer because the ones that are in the rooms are the standard dryers that attached to the wall. \nThe location of the hotel was perfect! It is a block away from the subway, close to shopping and wonderful restaurants, and within walking distance to the American Museum of Natural History. There is a great wine shop next door that had a huge selection. Across the street is Fairway's Market and Citarella that had everything you could want...great selection of cheeses, salamis, desserts, food, etc. A few blocks up the street is the well known Zabar's which, in my opinion, if you are a food lover you must check it out. Also, next door to the hotel is Viand Cafe that had a variety of home cooked choices. Can't forget to mention that there is a Starbuck's on the corner! Also, if you ever forget something (i.e, clothes, scarves, hats, coats, etc..), there is a Loehmann's near by so you can buy something there.\nI would definitely recommend and stay at Hotel Beacon on my next trip to NYC. It really is a great find!

GULP! I researched this hotel quite a bit and was impressed with two things the price and the loacation. On arrival after getting up at 2:30am in Aneheim to fly across, we were greeted by friendly porters and reception staff who quickly sorted out our luggage and keys. It was the 4th of July and so a very busy tourist day for Manhattan. The consierge kindly told us the quickest and best way to get to the Hudson River so we could see the fireworks and it was only a 10 min walk. We were impressed by the quality and size of our 2 bedroom apartment style rooms given the price. They managed to squeeze in 2 bathrooms which is a godsend with a family of 6. The Kitchenette had a fridge, oven and stovetop, another great plus for families.. The hotel has no restaurant but really this should not put you off as right next door is a great, economical diner that has been around forever and you can get a great breakfast, lunch or dinner there. There is also a Starbucks next to that so coffee is sorted. Even better was across the road there are 2 supermarkets, one is an upmarket gourmet foodies heaven with loads of pre made food, seafood, bakery items, cakes, pastas etc. The other is called Food World and has EVERYTHING you could possible want. We got breakfast items there like cereal and bagels. The apartment had a mini kitchen which meant we could save a little and eat in a bit more, after the family junk restaurants of Aneheim we craved fresh food. The hotel is a 2min walk to 72nd st subway station and 2 blocks to central park, if you walk down 72nd st you get to the part of the park where the John Lennon imagine memorial is. If you then head across and up you are hitting Park Ave before you know it and will have seen most of the major sites of the park on the way. \nAt night we would usually eat in Times Square, you must if you have teenagers take them to The Hard Rock Cafe, it has the best memorablilia and got our kids excited. Another top spot is the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co restaurant from the Forest Gump movie. My husband and I found a romantic Italian restaurant around the corner and managed a night out ALONE. \nI have no complaints about the hotel, we will stay there again and next time for longer, it was nice to be a little removed from the 24 hr feel of Time Square and near all the Sesame Street like houses that we all imagine when thinking of NYC. It is convenient to be near the suway, so don't be scared to use it, we would just ask a local and most were more than happy to help the clueless tourists from Oz.", "author": {"username": "Claireeliz", "num_cities": 11, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "num_reviews": 16, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "9B3B2D7D2C0727EAB9675F3251E4369A", "location": "NSW"}, "date_stayed": "July 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "December 20, 2010", "id": 90352512, "via_mobile": false}

If, however, you want great friendly and efficient service, and a large comfortable room in a great area of the city, the Beacon is for you.\nWe had a 1 bed king suite and it was huge. The bathroom was marble lined and spotlessly clean. Not huge but easily comparable to the average home bathoom in England. Lovely Gilchrist and Soames toiletries as well.\nThe king bed was lovely and comfortable and we could actually lay in bed and see the New York sky line ........amazing.\nThe living room with kitchen was fantastic. Although we didn't cook, we did use the coffee maker and free coffee. On my husbands birthday I went next door to the Viand cafe and got a breakfast takeout to eat in the room. We had everything 'american' that I could think to order. It was fantastic and a snip at $20 compared to the $98 we paid for room service at the Waldorf last time we came to New York.\nThe fridge is full size with a freezer compartment so you can easily go to the Fairway market to fill up on essentials if you want.\nThe area is amazing. Really pretty with tons of great restaurants and bars. The area feels totally safe to walk around even at night. I could give you a list of places to go but I think half the fun is finding them for yourself.\nThe hotel is really close to central park which is an absoulute delight. We just sat watching people for hours. I kept waiting for Woody Allen to appear from behind a tree as we encountered so many characters.\nI would personally not bother to stay anywhere else in New York now. Although the Waldorf was great last time, the suite at the Beacon was just as big and actually more comfortable. The area is also much more interesting and less of a 'rip off'.\nOne piece of advice for the ladies, buy yourself a duel voltage travel hairdryer in England to take with you (the babyliss 1200 is good). Your english hairdryer will have no ooompf and the one in the bathroom is only really good for short hair.\nMany thankss to the Beacon for making our stay so fantastic.

They have a great selection of fresh foods for all tastes.The 72nd Street subway is just 2 mins away and perfect for getting to midtown. All in all our stay at the Beacon was such a pleasure and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I plan on visiting New York again in a few years and at least now I won't have the hassle of finding a hotel, I know I'll be staying in the Beacon again.", "author": {"username": "pampers26", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "2B9CD479019AFA07F909213598C431CD", "location": "Dublin, Ireland", "num_helpful_votes": 1}, "date_stayed": "September 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "October 5, 2010", "id": 82235002, "via_mobile": false}

We arrived earlier than normal for check-in but got a room on the 15th floor immediately. The room was clean and fresh - one good-sized bed, bathroom and kitchenette. Our room faced north so the views weren't exactly spectacular if that's something you really want from your experience! Air conditioning worked like a charm and the black-out blind was superb. The only noise experienced was from the a/c machine itself but that's to be expected isn't it? Our room also contained a safe - great for leaving passports and extra cash at the hotel.\nThe bathroom was again a good size especially considering it is a hotel in NYC - the shower pressure was very powerful and the bathroom was immaculately clean (I'm a clean freak!). As other reviewers have said before, the kitchenette is very handy. We did what everyone else seems to do and bought stuff for breakfast and sometimes lunches from the Fairway market directly across the road. The kitchenette had the basics for in-room eating, along with tea and coffee making facilities. There was a list of additional items available from reception if needed but we managed fine! The fridge didn't seal closed properly but we just set it to the coldest temperature possible and it worked like a treat! \nThe staff were very friendly especially the guys working at the front door. They are a credit to the hotel and suggested places to eat which were appropriate for our needs. (We discovered our new favourite restaurant because of them - thanks!). Big Nicks burgers were awesome, Cafe Viand was nice - big portions of caesar salad which we had boxed up to go because we couldn't finish, Levains bakery had the best warm chocolate chip cookies I have EVER tasted and Gray's Papaya was good for a quick, light and cheap hotdog fix on the way home after a day/evening out. \nFree internet access was available in a small room with 2 computers just off the lobby. Again, as other reviewers have mentioned, it was very very slow! We ended up asking the concierge to print off our boarding passes from his computer which he did without any fuss. The laundry facilities on the 7th floor are brilliant. I think I was $1.25 for a small box of washing powder which would have done 2 washes then about $1.75 for use of the machine (don't quote me on the prices but I reckon they're close enough!). There were numerous washing machines and driers, along with a bench and vending machine if you're planning to wait. \nThe subway was a couple of minutes walk south and had great connections. We also used the bus to go across town and back up to the hotel from the bottom of Central Park - easy to navigate once you check out the maps at the bus stop otherwise they can appear a bit daunting! We bought a $27 unlimited 9-day metro card each from the subway station which was a great deal and also let us use the buses.\nMy photographs all show the inside of a suite on the 11th floor (we upgraded for our last night as a treat) and the view is also from this room. However, the bedroom is not dissimilar from a standard room (standard also had a work desk) but the bathroom in the suite appeared to be smaller than the standard. It was great having a separate livingroom in the suite but we had no problems staying in the standard room and would do so again!\nAll in all, a great hotel with lovely staff, plenty of space and basic amenities along with many great resaturants nearby!", "author": {"username": "Jillish2311", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 10, "num_type_reviews": 8, "id": "18FD9306918C94EB18AC1515EE3229A5", "location": "Dundee"}, "date_stayed": "September 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "October 4, 2010", "id": 82101293, "via_mobile": false}

I walked into my queen bed room and was absolutely amazed. It was sparkling clean and very inviting. There were 3 windows in the room with spectacular views. The paintings and furnishings were very tasteful and the overall ambiance of the room was of elegant comfort. I had gotten a VERY SPECIAL RATE so I expected a small, no frills room. I was greatly surprised! I could literally see a little of the sky line when I was lying in bed (if I opened the drapes). It was cool in the morning when I woke up and saw the sun rising behind a silhouette of the skyline!\nThe bed was extremely comfortable. The room was very quiet. The bathroom was immaculate and very modern and updated. There was a small kitchenette area complete with sink, mini fridge, microwave, stovetop, pots and pans, silverware, cups, plates and bowls. Although I didn't cook, I could have. I did keep a few items in the refrig and I used the ice a lot. I also used the coffee pot.\nThe hotel staff were ALWAYS 100% helpful and pleasant. I had many questions regarding restaurants, subway routes, catching the shuttle to the airport, etc. They were very patient and knowledgeable.\nThere was a computer room off the lobby that was convenient for printing off my boarding passes for the flight home and for checking on local tourist spots. \nI ate breakfast at the small restaurant adjoining the motel and it was good and reasonable. Usually, I left the motel and was gone most of the day and it was very easy to catch the subway. I could easily walk to Central park. There were lots of great restaurants and shops closeby. The HUGE grocery across the street, ( I think it was called the Fairway Market ) was incredible. I bought some cheese and apples there but it had immense selection---for example just in the \"olive department\", they had probably 10 BARRELS of fresh, different types of olives!!!! They also had a restaurant upstairs but I never was there at a meal time.\nAll in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this motel and you should check for special rates because I got a great deal.

We had originally wanted to get an apartment rather than 3 separate hotel rooms, but having researched it on this forum and realised it was a no-go, I started looking for hotel suites and found Hotel Beacon.\nIt was a fantastic choice - originally I could only book 2 one-bed suites on the internet, so I did this but emailed the hotel to see if they had any other availability. They got back to me really promptly, changed my booking to a 2-bed suite, and offered a discount. A great first impression.\nWe loved the neighbourhood - 5 min walk to the nearest subway station, 2 blocks from Central Park, close to lots of fantastic restaurants and bars. It was clean, felt safe, and like a 'local' neighbourhood - we much preferred it to midtown. \nThe hotel lobby was a bit non-descript, and the reception desk weren't the friendliest of people, but they were efficient. The room however was fantastic - a kitchen, dining area, sitting room with sofa bed, 2 bathrooms and 2 big double bedrooms. I can only assume that the small rooms here are the standard rooms and I think if I stayed again as a couple, I would go for a one-bed suite. Even though we were on Broadway I didn't hear any traffic noise when the windows were shut.\nThe hotel also had free internet in the lobby, with printer, which I used to check in for our flight. We ate breakfast at the diner next door most mornings, which was good and very convenient.\nAll in all we had a fantastic stay in NYC and the Beacon was a comfortable, pleasant and well-situation place to come back to.

We stayed in a large King Suite, with kitchenette and sofa bed. The room appeared to be recently renovated, and is tasteful decorated. The king size bed was extremely comfortable, and the quality of the bedding was great. Our room (#919) was perfectly quiet, since it was not facing the street, and was the last room on the hall. While it had no view (other than rooftops), I would give up a view anyday for quiet. The kitchen (with oven/stove/microwave/refrig) was an added \"plus\".The only reason for four stars instead of five: the AC in the living room was not working properly. We reported this on Sat., and as of today, had not been repaired. Fortunately, the milder temps, and the powerful bedroom AC, made the situation bearable. The front desk reduced our bill appropriately as a gesture of \"service recovery.\" The number of TV channels was infinite, and we especially appreciated having The Tennis Channel, since we were there to attend the US Open. The location is just a few short blocks from the 73 Ave. train station, which made moving throughout the city very easy . It is a short 30 minute taxi ride from LGA (appox. $35). Central Park is within walking distance. \nOther reviewers have mentioned the market across the street...but I would be remiss if I failed to comment that it was exceptionally convenient. We ate several meals in our room, thanks to the fully cooked meals that were available in this \"super-duper market\". No breakfast is offered at this hotel, but you don't need it...get breakfast from the market, or get it from the restaurant on the corner. \nThe front desk staff were very helpful, especially the Bell Hops. They offered detailed instructions on navigating the subway system.

A giant roach showed itself, we killed it & told the front desk that now they could send housekeeping up to my room, with their broom & dustpan to remove it. They promised that the exterminator would come by tomorrow. When I left for the day, they said the exterminator would be there at 1PM.

I had to make a last minute quick trip to NYC and all of my usual choices were booked. I was surprised because it was mid-week, but apparently there were a number of graduations and everyone was fully booked. I stumbled across Hotel Beacon and got what I believe was the last room. I paid more than I would for pleasure travel, but again given that it was my only choice I am not complaining. I believe the average rates are actually less than what I paid so I think the average value is fine. It was a suite with two double beds (more than I needed, but may be great on a future trip). I was quite surprised at the size as well. I am certain this suite was much larger than many Manahattan apartments. The bathroom was quite large for an NYC boutique. Though I did not need it, I loved having the option of the kitchenette. My room windows did not face the street, but were very new commercial quality and it was the quietest night I've ever spent in NYC. My only complaint (which I expressed in the form of a suggestion to the front desk) was to upgrade the shower head (it was adequate, but the standard type from the hardware store). I feel like they paid alot of attention to detail on every mater, but to compete fully in the boutique market the shower needs to feel invigorating. Hopefully they'll make the change by the time I need to stay again.

You can even buy a cheap lunch or dinner by packing your own meal at a small buffet counter. Simple food and hot too. I think it is $6 per pack. There was rice, mashed potatoes, veggie, meats.

You can walk to Sentral Park from the Hotel in about 15 mins. There is a starbucks and a Viandi restaurant right on the corner of the block which we used mostly for breakfasts. There is a fab deli opposite, and a big supermarket. There is also a Liqor store the otherside of the Beacon Theatre, handy if you want wine for the fridge in the room!!\nThe only critiscms I have for the Hotel is that the first room we stayed in had bed bugs.

It is in the Upper West Side, away from the hustle and bustle of downtown and Times Square. This was appealing to us, as there is so much to see on the way downtown. Taxis are cheap compared to Australia so for us, a $10 cab ride to Times Square was great. I would recommend walking through most of the city though, as there is so much to see and do along the way!

The city is much cleaner and safer than I ever expected!\nThe rooms were fantastic! Recently renovated, with a funky green throughout. The 1 bedroom apartments are huge, with either 1 king or 2 doubles in a separate bedroom plus kitchen facilities and a lounge room. Bathrooms are on the small side, but there is so much space elsewhere it is not a drama. \nThe lobby is quite small, but this is also what we found to be appealing.

The decor is rather dated (circa 2001), so it already feels like it's time for a remodel. The bathroom is ridiculously small -- sink, toilet, tub/shower literally touching each other. Be warned, if you get a room on one of the lower floors (where they first tried to place us) your view will likely be a brick wall with no to little natural light.\nThe service was almost non-existent. For this reason, we avoided interacting with the front desk and other staff, but at check in and other times we did need to talk to them, they either took 10-20 rings to answer the phone or didn't acknowledge us at the desk (not even a \"I'll be right with you.\") \nSure, it's the Upper West Side and the location is great, and it's a value if budget is a big factor.

My husband & I stayed at this hotel about 7 years ago, and the hotel has been significantly upgraded during this time. We were assigned a room on the 9th floor, located next to the elevators. The room was spacious for 2 adults - two closets (one with a safe), a living area with a 3-seater sofa which may have had a pullout bed (I didn't check); 2 flat screen TV's - one on the bedroom, one in the living area; a cozy kitchenette with fridge, stove, oven, etc; a queen-sized bed; some drawer space; and a small but usable bathroom - the water pressure was average but heated up quickly and stayed warm throughout the shower. A door seperated the living area from the bedroom for added privacy. There is a significant number of channels available on the TV so finding something to watch shouldn't be difficult. The room had 2 large windows overlooking the NYC cityscape. Adorable artwork lining the walls provided a more comfortable \"home\" feel rather than just a hotel room. Wi-Fi was provided for a \"nominal fee\" and you had to get a code from the reception desk - we never used this service so I'm unable to comment. The only downsides were since our room was so close to the elevator, we heard the pullies and the opening/closing of the doors all night; the carpet was a bit frayed in corners. Also, the heater in our room was noisy and turned on and off all night, which could possibly disturb someone who is a light sleeper. The deskman provided a good recommendation for a nearby restaurant, and the meal was delicious. Across the street is a market and the subway is about a block or two away. Overall, this hotel helped us to feel more like New Yorkers and less like the tourists that we are - and isn't vacation all about escape??", "author": {"username": "TravelOC2NZ", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "num_reviews": 11, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "A99DB8A61B69B7ED7CAD3B5AD02186C2", "location": "Auckland"}, "date_stayed": "April 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "April 8, 2012", "id": 127446577, "via_mobile": false}

A well provisioned Kitchenette area with fridge, microwave, hob unit and toaster with sufficient utensils for the two of us.\nThe 32\" TV had more channels than we cared to watch. A nice touch was the Iphone docking station. The rooms was cleaned daily to a good standard and even though we were close to the elevator the room was quiet.\nThere is no restaurant or Bar in this Hotel but we didn't find this a problem as there is an excellent diner next door (The Viand) and some local bars quite close.\nThough not in the heart of town the hotel is only 2 blocks from the park in a very pleasant district with some very reasonably priced restaurants close by. Access downtown was easy with frequent 1/2/3 subway trains very close at 72 st. The Metrocard was great value at $27 for a weeks unlimited travel.\nAll the staff were pleasant, and happy to give advice and recommendations.\nOverall I give this Hotel a high rating as it was of a much higher standard than I was expecting for the price.", "author": {"username": "zippyHull", "num_cities": 4, "num_helpful_votes": 10, "num_reviews": 4, "num_type_reviews": 4, "id": "338351F2C5C8B2D49A07480444E65655", "location": "Hull"}, "date_stayed": "February 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "date": "February 24, 2010", "id": 56970076, "via_mobile": false}

If you are the type of person who thrives on bright lights, the hustle of the town centre don't come here. The hotel is two very small blocks from the 72 street subway, turn left out of the hotel. It took no time at all to get to where ever we wanted on the Island. Fairway supermarket is over the road but if you cross over, then turn right there is another smaller super market on the next block which is not so crowded. However, we really liked Wholefoods - get off the Metro at Columbus circle and head for the shopping centre, the supermarket is downstairs. It has loads of fresh, semi prepared meals or buffet type offerings but the system for lining up at the tills is really odd and I fell foul of it, tut tut. \nAnyway, back to the hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom suite on the 12th floor with a view out the front. We had a bedroom with TV, storage was excellent. The lounge had a chair and sofa, big TV, round dining table, a work table (for computer with lamp) and kitchenette. The kitchenette had a toaster, fridge/freezer, gas cooker, whistling kettle, coffee maker, one saucepan, frying pan, cutlery and plates. They do supply tea towels and some washing up liquid was left. The bathroom was small but perfectly fine. A free copy of USA today was left outside the door weekdays. An ironing board and safe was located in the hallway. It was hot air central heating but it did not affect my asthma. This broke down one evening and an engineer came right up to fix it at 10 in the night which I thought excellent. If you want newspapers, there is a newstand over the road. Starbucks is located to the right, just over the road which is useful if you have just arrived and are starving. We went to the little restaurant on the right of the hotel as you go out which was nice but once you add in service charge, tips etc, we thought it was getting too pricey to return. There are lots of small little places to eat around here which would cover every foodie interest. We appreciated being able to cook for ourselves as it did save a few bucks plus by the time we got home in early evening we were too tired to contemplate going out again!\nCheck in was excellent. We had to sign a declaration promising not to smoke in a non-smoking room and leave credit card details which were used to pay for wi fi of 9.95 dollars a day, the connection was excellent. If you are wondering about how to print out an electronic boarding pass, go down to the lobby; to the left of the lifts is a small cubby hole with two computers and two printers. The printers were down the night we wanted them but the chap on duty suggested we email our pdf to him and he kindly printed it out for us. There is a fitness centre that guests can use (not sure where it is) but is was 20 dollars a day.\nSome general tips. Get a metro card for the appropriate number of days, excellent value and good service. Go early in the morning to the popular locations such as Empire State Building and the ferry over to Liberty Island as it can get crazy. Central park is within strolling distance. We left a tip each day for the room attendant. Street parking around there looked fine though you'd need to go around the blocks a few times and hope to get lucky. Easy to get a taxi, just ask the DoorMan and the fares were very reasonable, the metro is not so good crossing east west so this was a good option.\nOverall, an excellent experience and I can't compliment the staff enough.", "author": {"username": "21Summer", "num_cities": 22, "num_helpful_votes": 41, "num_reviews": 38, "num_type_reviews": 29, "id": "A9D1F22BC416E73F3414BA8CB9F2E234", "location": "Wales"}, "date_stayed": "January 2010", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "January 10, 2010", "id": 53124987, "via_mobile": false}

We checked other hotel rates and reviews but decided to go with what we knew....The Beacon. We got a double room. We had asked for early check-in and a high floor, but that just about never works, but, upon our early arrival, our room was ready, and on a high floor. Check in was very quick and smooth. The desk attendent was friendly and personable. The room didn't have a great view, but no matter....it was good enough. When we reserved the room on the website, it asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking and we reserved the non-smoking room. Upon check-in, we were presented with a paper to sign, acknowledging that it was a non-smoking room, and, if we smoked in it, we would be charged 250 dollars for cleaning. Not a problem. We weren't going to smoke. However, there was someone on our floor at the time who was moved out of their room and charged for smoking. Though we didn't smell the smoke in our room, with their door open to the hallway during their move and subsequent cleaning, the smoke smell was pretty bad.\nOur room was totally updated and was very nice. The only real downside was that the bathroom was small, but the sink was wide, so you sort of had to lean against the sink if you were using the toilet. Not a real problem, but I had to wonder why they didn't go with a smaller sink. It was quite cold in NYC while we were there, and our thermostat was apparently set to stay at 68 F degrees. Cutting it up only made the blower blow, but not make it any warmer, so it sometimes felt like cold air. We happened upon a housekeeper and asked her about it. While she didn't understand much English, upon our return to the room, the thermostat had been adjusted and we got it warmer in the room.\nLocation is great. Really close to a subway station that is a stop on both the local and the express trains. Fairway Market across the street would have most anything you would like, foodwise, and we bought sodas and stuff for breakfast there. A short walk to Lincoln Center, and Central Park.

Diner next door excellent for basic meals, superb [huge] breakfast deals, good value dinner. Lots of other dining options within an easy walk casual to top end. Great range of day to day shops - supermarket over the road wonderful! All staff were very helpful and responsive - a late check out was no problem. Main negative was internet access wi fi charged daily, no discounts for longer and no flexible time block plans. Good connection but $9.95 a day is steep and adds up over the week - would prefer to purchase 10 or 20 hours to use as required. \nOverall though this hotel offers excellent value and if I'm in New York again no doubt at all that I'll stay here - a tiny room in a busy, noisy mid town location could easily cost double. Here you really can feel part of the city away from the main tourist trail.", "author": {"username": "frequentflyerSeaford", "num_cities": 28, "num_helpful_votes": 28, "num_reviews": 51, "num_type_reviews": 30, "id": "C6457C849592DA9949976A864594B5E2", "location": "Brighton, United Kingdom"}, "date_stayed": "September 2009", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 16, 2009", "id": 42221409, "via_mobile": false}

Check-in was prompt and courteous and we were on our way to our room within minutes. Unfortunately, we were disappointed in the size of the area where the sofa bed was located, with its adjoining tiny kitchenette (once the sofa bed was opened, you could not get to the window). As to the sofa bed comfort, it was most uncomfortable for our granddaughter, but on the following morning, upon leaving for the day, when the manager was notified, an additional mattress pad was placed on the bed and it increased her comfort considerably. There are more closets than rooms. Each one is enormous, with lots of hangers. The bathroom is very small, with minimal shelf space and no exhaust fan, thus, it became very steamy after showering. On the plus side, the shower pressure was outstanding. The towels were thick and fluffy, but we had to ask each day for additional towels, or helped ourselves to some from the cart. There was some noise from adjoining rooms, but this was not a major issue. Overall, the staff could not have been nicer. The location of the hotel is terrific - near a subway and buses.\nThe Fairway Market, across the street, is as advertised. If they don't have it, it doesn't exist. As a matter of fact, we had dinner twice in their upstairs restaurant - service and food is excellent.\nLet us say a word, as other posters have indicated, about the restaurant mentioned several times, \"La Vela\", 373 Amsterdam Ave (at 75th or 76th St.). We dined there twice. The food is not pretentious but is terrific, the service is excellent and the wines reasonable priced, as is the food.\nWe also ate at Fusha, just around the corner from the hotel on Amsterdam Ave (at 75th St.). It is Asian fusion, not inexpensive, but excellent, and again, the staff is very good and friendly.\nWe recommend getting a Metro Pass for the time you are in the city.

Housekeeping was good, we came back at the end of each day to a very clean and tidy room.\nFront desk staff were efficient, but never overly friendly. Hotel is in an excellent spot across from Fairway supermarket, close to subway stop and a few blocks from central park. \nWe also ate at the restuarant above the Fairway supermarket. Also located next door is the Viand Cafe where we found the food to a bit more expensive than other diners in the area and the service a bit slow and unattentive.

The room is cheaply but tastefully furnished and the full kitchenette was a plus for me as I took advantage of all the epicurean markets along Broadway (definitely check out Zabars!) and had a marvellous breakfast in my room. The only downside, especially for business travelers, is that there is a $9.95 charge for wireless in the room.

We were not disappointed and really enjoyed our stay here. The biggest plus for us were the very large suites. Traveling with 2 teenage boys it was great having the extra space and kitchenette to store extra food for hungry teens. We shopped accross the street at the Fairway Market for food to keep on hand for breakfast to start our day and late night snacks when coming back in. The size of the rooms far exceeded our expectations.\nWe arrived 1 hr prior to check in time and were given the keys asap. The whole check in process took less than 10 minutes which was outstanding. Our only minor issue was that we requested a \"higher\" floor when making reservations directly with the hotel but were only put on the 7th floor next to the elevator. We never did hear the elevator but could hear our neighbors next door. I woke up around 12 mid. to hear a bag rattling thinking the wife got up during the night and it was the lady next door. The walls were not insulated well. The suite was extremely clean and the house keeping staff could not have been better. It was the 1st hotel we have ever stayed where our room was cleaned by 10:00 and we had the same cleaning staff. They were very friendly and accomodating when we asked them to leave extra towels and provisions.\nThe only other small issues we had were 1st the air conditioning, there is a sign noting it shuts off when you leave, certainly wise for energy savings to the hotel, but it doesn't seem to turn on until you come back in. It was always a little stuffy when we came back.. It did cool down fairly quickly. I think it may have been sensor activated. The other issue, there was no fan in the bathroom which we found odd since the whole place was recently renovated. All in all it was a great place to stay, mainly due to the cleanliness and short walk to the subway. If you took the express train, it was only a very short ride to Time Square and other tourist attractions. It was also in a great neighborhood where we always felt safe walking at night.

The beds are very comfy. Our room was very quiet and had a magnificent view (the hotel had kindly put us on the 22nd floor given the nature of our visit and its duration). Housekeeping were very attentive and only too happy to bring anything additional you needed and in a very timely fashion. The bathroom is very small but was adequate for our needs and again very clean. Only gripe with the room was the aircon - didn't seem to very efficient as it cut out regularly and was quite noisy - this did interfere with sleeping on a couple of evenings. Hotel also has free internet for guests which we really appreciated as we were able to converse regularly with our hubbys and kids via email.\nThe hotel's location is fantastic - much quieter than midtown because you're some distance from Times Square (this was one of the reasons we chose this hotel!), Short walk to Central Park and absolutely brimming with restaurants, diners, cafes, bars, grocery stores frequented by locals, not just tourists. All the major attractions are easily accessible via the subway which is very close by, taxi or walking (we walked to Times Square regularly - took about 25min). \nMy only gripe with the hotel, and its only a small one, was with the front desk staff. With the exception of the gentleman who checked us in who was polite and provided us lots of useful info, the remaining staff were certainly not friendly and not very helpful when you needed assistance or information. A smile goes a long way guys.... We also found the night concierge to be too pushy in terms of trying to sell tickets, tours etc.. At times we were followed to the lift!! We booked everything we did directly with the tour operators, bus company, theatres etc.. easily and for a lot less than what was being offered at the hotel (assume the markup was commission but it was hefty!).\nGenerally speaking though this hotel was brilliant for the price, very good value and in a superb location.

The front desk said they had arrived and to pick them up from the concierge. The concierge went back to check, said they didn't have them and sent me back to the front desk. Frustrated, I went up to the room, only to find that both packages had been left in the room already. Great service, but why couldn't the concierge have known that the packages had already been brought to the room? On another day, I got another Fed Ex and this time, the concierge left a voice mail for me to come get it. A little consistency would be nice.\n2.) When I checked in, I was surprised that they didn't swipe a credit card for incidentals (the room was a direct bill to someone else.) A couple of days later I sent some dry cleaning with the valet, and when I got back, there was a voice mail to come down to the front desk and leave a credit card imprint before they would release my suit and shirts.\n3.) Finally, the first few days the room was fairly warm and I noticed the air conditioner in the living room wasn't cooling. I asked at the front desk for someone to come fix it and no one came.

The hotel is a quiet (if New York is ever quiet) retreat from the bustle of the tourist areas.\nThis hotel is recently updated in quiet shades of green and neutral colors. It has nice flat screen TVs and pretty dang comfy beds! It's clean with nothing scary in the bathroom! t's almost directly on the 1,2,3 subway line and you can get just abut anywhere from there. We sure did!\nWe stayed in a one bedroom with two double beds in the actual bedroom and the living room had a pull out couch. The beds were great, not so much the couch, but that's usually true with any pull out! Yes, I said a bedroom, totally separate from the living area. It was great. They have other configurations too. You can have access to the health club for an extra $20 per person a day. We did not find this a necessary expense so I can't tell you anything about the club. The gift shop (or it used to be a gift shop) is undergoing remodeling and I'm not sure what the outcome of that will be. It was a vast empty spot when we were there. There is a theater right next door also called the Beacon but it is seriously in need of rennovation and is not open. \nAll of the rooms have a tiny little kitchen with a smaller size refrigerator, a tiny stove with an oven, a microwave and a little sink. There is a toaster too along with dishes, a couple of cooking pans and silverware. This was very nice to have and we used it every day for breakfast rather than try and all get completely dressed and ready and then go somewhere for breakfast. There is a wonderful market (Fairway) directly across the street. It has everything you need and plenty you don't need but wil buy anyway!\nThere is also a wine and spirits store on the corner and a decent restaurant right next door. There is a Lohman's across the street which was handy when my daughter forgot to pack her leggings. We just ran over there and picked up a pair for $6.99. Walk up the street and you are at a great bagle shop, H&H. Be warned, they only take cash, but have an ATM right in the store! Central Park is also only a few blocks away. Big Nick's Pizza and Burgers is up the street a block or two. Good pizza, didn't try the burgers.\nThe neighborhood is pleasant and we never felt unsafe walking in the area. The building is 25 stories and our room was on the 23rd floor. We paid about $380/night for this room. I thought it was a bargain considering the prices near Times Square, the size of the room and the fact that there was a kitchen. In fact, after spending time in the busier areas, I was really glad we chose to stay at the Beacon. Just coming up from the subway into the neighborhood was calming, especially at night. I liked it.\nThe front desk at check in was nice. Didn't deal with them much after that. There is a Concierge but we didn't find them terribly useful. We weren't really depending on them for anything so that wasn't a big deal. Could be an issue if you really wanted them to do something for you. We could have caught them on a bad day too, you just never know for sure.\nOverall this was a great stay.

The hotel is located in the upper west side, nestled among bakeries, organic markets, and coffee shops (or perhaps I should say latte shops!). The area seems to be a mixture of visitors and upscale New Yorkers walking little dogs. I personally really preferred this area, away from the concrete jungle mid-town. The Beacon is across from two large markets, and we found the kitchen was an excellent option to break up restaurant life. The only minor complaint I may have is the Kitchen is poorly equipped, as usual if you want to cook anything bring a kitchen knife in your checked bag. Likewise, a big bowl of some sort to make sald would have been very handy. The coffee maker in the kitchen uses those little Keruig (?) cuplets which are kindly supplied at the hotel, so that was handy and delicious in the morning. Given the many comments on trip advisor about NYC generally, I must say the suite we were in at the Beacon was a generous size. It was spotlessly clean, and the view from the upper floors was fantastic. I did note one somewhat unhappy couple changing their room one morning, so perhaps the lower floor rooms are not as great. If you want to get something reasonable for dinner one night, try walking up a couple of blocks to Zabors and getting the pre-made spag and meatballs. The cheese selection was also out of this world. We really enjoyed being able to have the odd meal in our suite, and did not feel hard done by, simply, because there was such tasty take away and the room was lovely. I guess it goes without saying, that feeding a mittful of children in NYC can be a tad pricey in the restaurant scene. The staff at the Beacon were polite and kind across the board, not a bump anywhere. Also, the Beacon is a short walk to both Central and Riverside parks, both great places to walk and or jog if you are so inclined. NYC is such an amazing spot to see and experience, the Beacon was certainly not a bargain, but we did feel it was worth it's weight in gold.

We booked the hotel through our travel agent, after reading previous reviews first.\nThe Hotel is in a very secure part of Manhatten. I was a little concerned initially about the location as on three previous visits i have stayed South of Columbus Circus, usually at hotels between 33rd and 50th. I thought I might have selected a hotel a little too far away from the main tourist attractions. However the transportation network is excellent. We were at Rockerfeller Centre within 20 minutes of stepping on the train at 72nd and Broadway....including walking time.\nWe arrived at the hotel at about 2pm and alas our room was not ready. So we had to sit in the lobby and wait for 40 minutes. After a long flight that was a bit disappointing. However everything was uphill from there.\nMy parents and i shared an room with excellent facilities, including kitchenette, living area, two televisions and a host of facilities we didn't actually get to use. Our room was facing broadway and i have to say that it was extremely quiet for the most part. There was, at times, some traffic noise, but to be honest, it was not too intrusive and did not affect our enjoyment of the holiday.\nThe room has a safe which is almost idiot proof and secure. Our most valuable items - including passports, insurance documents etc - were placed there.\nThe beds were perhaps a tad small for double beds. It was great for me of course as I had one to myself. I think my parents could have done with a little more room.\nThe room service was excellent. You are given the option of having your towels and bed linen changed every day, or to have them changed less frequently. This, I believe, is a concession to the more environmentally aware visitors.\nOpposite the hotel is a small market, ideally placed for visitors that want to do their own cooking. However there is a restaurant next to the hotel which serves excellent breakfast, lunch and evening meals. We used the market - after the first few days of finding our feet - to purchase our breakfast - cereal, milk and bagels. This was a lot cheaper than buying breakfast and is heartily recommended. \nThe subway is three blocks away on 72nd and Broadway. From there the whole of the main tourist spots were accessible. My advice is to get a metrocard which will allow you to travel on bus and train alike.\nIt should be noted that the front of the hotel had scaffolding due to some rennovation work on certain floors that was over-running. However we were not inconvenienced or affected by this work.\nThe staff were friendly but not in our faces...None of this sometimes false 'have a nice day' stuff, but still good at anticipating needs. My advice is to use the concierge to flag down taxis and to provide advice about tourist haunts. We were too reticent to do this - it's a British thing alas - and missed out on some useful service and advice given to others. You can grab a subway map from the concierge desk. This is helpful..\nThe hotel does arrange transportation to the airport(s). However the cost is a tad expensive when conpared with some other companies. If we go again we'll make our own arrangements and save some bucks! The service provided though by the airport bus arranged could not be faulted.\nThe hotel was frequented by a lot of Europeans. We heard German, French, Italian, Spanish and I believe Polish spoken there. There were even a couple of Australians. So it has a mixture of people. \nIn short, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to all and sundry.", "author": {"username": "triptriptrip", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "uk", "id": "21C28370D7FB2E5E21CEBA464DB72135"}, "date_stayed": "September 2008", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 27, 2008", "id": 20416223, "via_mobile": false}

It is on Broadway and is less than 10 minutes walk into Central Park using the W 72nd Street entrance.\nThe location is great. It is a relaxed, friendly and safe part of Manhattan. You are away from the hustle and bustle of midtown, yet it is only a 5 minute subway ride into midtown or a little longer downtown. There is a major subway station at 72nd Street (2 minutes walk away) that goes anywhere you want.\nThere is a very good supermarket (Fairway) straight across the road if you need anything. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes around the area (there is a 24 hour cafe right next door). Some are cheap and the food is average at best. Others are a lot better but obviously cost more. Generally, you get what you pay for. If restaurants / cafes are important to you, do a little research before you go. We found at least half a dozen good restaurants / cafes within 10 minutes walking distance.\nThe Hotel appears to be quite busy. There are quite a few people checking in each day but the staff were efficient and polite and nobody ever has to wait more than 5 minutes at Reception. The lifts are on the small side and they could do with another lift. Occasionally, you might have to wait a minute or so for a lift.\nOur room was a 1 bedroom suite on one of the higher floors. The cost was $280 per night which I thought was pretty good value. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable and had a kitchenette. Our room faced east which meant we had a good view (partially obstructed) of the bottom part of Central Park and the taller buildings in mid-town.\nMy only point of caution is about the Hotel's Internet room. It has 2 computers and is tiny. The Internet is free so there is high demand. There is a time limit of 30 minutes so it's a bit of a problem if you want to use it for longer than that. I found myself going down every morning before 5 am so I had the place to myself.\nAll in all, the Beacon is a very good Hotel.

It was sometimes very cosy - sometimes downright stressful - with the kids.\nAnyway, here are my accommodation reviews. I\u2019ll mention side trips and tours too. Sometimes the accommodation was arranged through a travel agent, but on a couple of occasions I organised it direct. \nWe spent 6 nights at the Beacon Hotel in New York, including Christmas Day. We actually saw this accommodation favourably reviewed in a travel article in our local Sunday paper, and made enquiries direct as a result. It\u2019s located on Broadway on the Upper West side.\nWe had a 1 bedroom suite, which was capable of sleeping 5 - there were 2 double beds in the bedroom and a fold-out couch in the separate living area. Ultimately, we took another double room as it seemed a bit cramped to have 5 of us there, especially over Christmas. Management arranged this on the spot, and conveniently, the room was immediately next door. \nThe suite had a large living area and kitchenette, complete with large fridge, stove (hotplates and oven), cutlery, cooking utensils, crockery and glasses. Housekeeping was generally very quick with our requests for such things as extra towels, a sharp knife and cutting board, and a tray of champagne flutes.\nThere was a TV in the bedroom, along with drawers, comfy chair, wardrobe and room safe, as well as the 2 double beds (quite a large room). In the sitting room, there was another TV on a chest of drawers, the couch, a desk/table and 2 chairs, a coffee table and 2 other end tables tables, lamps, and plenty of room for a trundle bed, which management provided when the fold-out couch was found to be broken (in terms of being a fold-out bed - it was still ok as a couch). The other standard double room had 2 double beds, desk/table and chairs, comfy chair, drawers, wardrobe, safe and a small kitchenette with hotplates, crockery, etc. The bathrooms in each were a reasonable size for New York standards. There was a large laundry on a floor above us, with coin-operated washing machines and dryers (great to be able to wash clothes properly after a couple of weeks on the road). Wireless internet was $10.00 per day. The hotel is quite old (most buildings are in New York), but don\u2019t let this put you off.\nWe were particularly happy to have the living area for Christmas (I even bought a small tree and had some Christmas lights). The kitchenette and large fridge were a delight after so long in ordinary rooms with a bar fridge (if you were lucky). The best thing was the huge market across the road, which served every kind of food imaginable (from fresh fruit to sushi, gourmet cheeses and olives to TV dinners). There was a liquor store next door too. This meant that you could be completely self sufficient in your room. We had all breakfasts, several dinners and even a lunch in our room. It was a relief from having to eat out every night (and day) - we cooked up pasta in our room instead.\nAs far as the location was concerned, it depends what you want to be close to. New York is a huge city, so the Beacon is miles away from, say, Little Italy and Wall Street, the United Nations, the Guggenheim museum, or even the Empire State Building. Conversely, we walked easily to Central Park, Strawberry Fields and the Dakota, the American Museum of Natural History and even Columbus Circle. The subway was nearby, which is the best way to cheaply get around the longer distances (get a multi-journey ticket - dispatched by vending machines using a credit card on subway stations). Close by was a multiplex cinema with an IMAX theatre too. Like most big cities, you will never get a hotel in NY that is convenient to everything.\nAs for tours, we got our money\u2019s worth from a City Pass (valid for 9 days to see 6 attractions), and it saved us time when queuing for the Empire State Building. The City Pass included a boat cruise (Hudson River, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, and the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge) which was well worth it. [Hint - trade your travel agent\u2019s voucher for the book of City Pass tickets at a less popular attraction, where the queues are shorter. For instance, at the Empire State Building, there\u2019s a huge queue to get your City Pass, then you\u2019ll have to join the back of the queue for the building itself.] The Gray Line hop-on hop-off loops (open top double-decker buses) were good too (both of these were purchased through the travel agent before we left). \nWe also did an awesome helicopter ride over Manhattan through Liberty Helicopters (the chopper takes 7 passengers plus the pilot) on Christmas Day, but that, as you can imagine, was hellishly expensive. \nThe Empire State Building is a must, but I\u2019d recommend the Top of the Rock too (the viewing decks at the top of the Rockefeller Centre). From there, you get a much better view of Central Park, plus you look south over Manhattan and see the Empire State Building too (which you can\u2019t do when you\u2019re atop it!). The big bonus is that, whilst it took about 2 hours to get to the top of the Empire State Building, there was virtually no wait to get to the Top of the Rock. We went mid-afternoon, and I stayed until the evening to get the sunset and night photos.\nThe Beacon was a great choice, for the kitchenette and for it\u2019s location across the road from the market. I\u2019d stay there again, especially if I was in Manhattan for more than a night or two.", "author": {"username": "seagullrob", "num_cities": 71, "num_helpful_votes": 180, "num_reviews": 81, "num_type_reviews": 79, "id": "30EB88A695150FDA99AB06535437DC3E", "location": "Brisbane, Queensland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2007", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 16, "date": "January 21, 2008", "id": 12834396, "via_mobile": false}

Our room was on the 18th floor, one of the floors that has already been refurbished. While we were there, work was progressing on at least one other floor, but we were only aware of this when the lift stopped to allow a workman on or off. No disturbances to report. I assume that all the rooms will be refurbished eventually.\nWe were delighted with our room. We were lucky to get a corner room at the back, which meant fantastic views over to the edge of Central Park. It was plenty big enough, finished to a really high standard, with a huge bed, TV to match and a useful well-equipped kitchenette. We really can't think of anything to even mention as a downside. \nThe hotel is well-situated, the area is a lot less frantic than midtown. It's an easy walk to Central Park and with a good selection of bars, diners and restaurants nearby. The Fairway market across the street is open from 6:00am till after midnight and has everything you could possibly want in the way of food and drink. Zabars deli and H&H Bagels are a short walk up Broadway and 72nd St subway station is about 3 minutes away in the opposite direction, so great for getting around. \nI know this reads like a brochure for the hotel, but we really did find it that good - and we are fairly critical travellers not afraid to register our displeasure if things aren't up to scratch. \nWe plan to visit NYC again within the year, and having stayed at the Beacon we wouldn't entertain the idea of staying anywhere else.", "author": {"username": "bingojesus", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "num_reviews": 3, "location": "Manchester", "id": "D9CB11799B89740D08E3BA6D54D181C9"}, "date_stayed": "June 2008", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "July 25, 2008", "id": 18251004, "via_mobile": false}

Our suite was huge and comfortable and quite clean. You just can't beat the space for the price. The staff was friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed the restaurant upstairs at the Fairway market. The food was great and really affordable - we ended up eating there several times. There is also a Starbucks right on the corner.

He told us, quite confidently that we would be the last stop on the shuttle and the trip would take about 45 minutes and so we had him book it for us. Well, when the shuttle arrived, the surly driver informed us that the Beacon is the first stop and the trip would take closer to an hour and a half.

We waited about a half hour and no engineer. Another call to the desk and again we were told they would send an engineer. Another half hour passed and noise is still continuing & no engineer.

As I approached the desk with steam coming out of my ears, I said to the desk man \u201cI am room 2304\u201d!

The review posted by \"504\" on 11/21 was right almost word for word, shabby window treatments, carpets, wallpaper, etc. Another poster described the stuff as \"faded.\"\nAll true. It depends on what you want. For us (a family of 4) the one bedroom suite was by far the largest space we stayed in: the\nbedroom was around 12 x 14 and the living room was probably 12 x 20 -- huge by Manhattan standards. (see pictures) But the place was a little worn. We're used to Marriott's and this was a couple of grades below that.\nLocation: this is not a tourist area; its more a neighborhood. I don't think theres much to do in Times Square (not into plays, ESPN, etc.) so I prefer not to stay there. This is an exiciting neighborhood with a real urban feel to it and just walking around is fun enough. The hotel is 2 blocks from the 72nd express stop on the Broadway line so its easy to get most anywhere, although at a fare of $2 - the $8 fare for a family of 4 adds up. Cab fare to the Chelsea galleries should be around $14; Canal Street should be about $18. If you want this neighborhood with some style try the On the Ave hotel 2 blocks north: more expensive and much smaller but very modern rooms.\nFood store: Best and cheapest is to shop in Fairway, the huge (by Manhattan standards) supermarket across the street or its better competitor 2 blocks north same side of the street. All the normal stuff in both stores plus tons of cheeses and prepared gourment foods. Worth a look even if you don't buy.\nRestaurants: Amsterdam and Columbus (the two street parallel to and east of Broadway) are loaded with restaurants -- walking and looking is fun by itself.\nFast Food: The two pizza places north of the hotel on the east side of Broadway were (surprisingly for NY) mediocre to bad. If you want pizza, Little Nicks (2 blocks north, west side of Broadway) was outstanding. Gigi's, about 5 blocks south, west side of Broadway, had delicious quessadillas, and the Jewish deli (3 blocks north, east side of Broadway) was mediocre to good and a little expensive for fast food", "author": {"username": "FAMILY44444", "num_cities": 31, "num_helpful_votes": 119, "num_reviews": 60, "num_type_reviews": 38, "id": "663AAF53644CD91A195036162D060B6C", "location": "latham ny"}, "date_stayed": "November 2007", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "date": "November 27, 2007", "id": 11106831, "via_mobile": false}

It was the right decision. The Beacon is located in a great Upper West Side neighborhood, loaded with great stores and restaurants, and only a block from the 72nd St subway. You can be in Times Square in less than ten minutes, and from there it's easy to reach any part of NYC. This hotel is well suited to families, especially if you have a teenager that needs her privacy. Our suite was spacious by New York standards, with a well-appointed living room with a sofabed (which became my daughter's domain), a full kitchen, and a good-sized bedroom with two queen beds. We were on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway, which offered great views but was rather noisy throughout the night. The Fairway Market across the street is a great place to shop, but they take deliveries around the clock, and the trucks idle the whole time. If you're a light sleeper, demand a room at the back. I thought our suite was very nicely decorated, with no signs of wear and tear whatsoever. The beds were comfy, all the appliances worked, and we had plenty of towels and kitchen utensils. Although the traffic noise was constant, we never heard a peep from our neighbors, no running water, flushing, TV, nothing. The elevators were a bit slow but we never had to wait longer than 2 minutes. The housekeepers were friendly and gave us whatever we asked for no questions asked, but some of the people at the front desk could use a refresher course in customer service, or maybe a surgical procedure to remove their attitude. But there were also some very friendly clerks who went out of their way to help. Getting back to the Fairway, this is an incredible market, with an amazing selection of meats, cheeses, produce, and deli items, all very reasonably priced. The store is open until 1:00am, so my advice is go late at night, because in the afternoon and early evening \nthe aisles are packed to the gills. If you're not into grocery shopping, there are dozens of great restaurants within a five minute walk.

About ten years ago, we stayed at this property as part of a package deal, and really liked it. This year marks our fourth time to stay at the Beacon. We got the double double suite for 3 persons. This was a bedroom with 2 double beds and a seperate room that had a sitting room and a complete kitchen set-up. Having the extra room was handy for when one of us was up early we could go about things without awakening the others. \n The lobby of the hotel has been totally renovated and is a lot brighter and roomier and has a much better floorplan. The room was neat and clean. The kitchen comes complete with microwave, stove, toaster, refrigerator/freezer, dishes and silverware. While we're not ones to cook in the room, one day it poured down rain so we crossed the street to Fairway Market and got some snacks and drinks. (Sidenote: The Fairway Market is a marvel unto itself. Huge variety and good pricing. You have to see it to appreciate it.) \n It's true that the rooms are no showplace, but everything was clean and comfortable. That's all we really wanted. Generally we're not in the room a whole lot anyway. When you're tired from sightseeing all day, it doesn't matter if the comforter doesn't match the walls or if the sofa cushion design is a little worn. A USA Today newspaper is delivered to the door every morning, which is nice to have. \n The only real downside to the visit was the elevators. In the past the elevators have been a little slow, but of no concern, but this time the wait time for elevators was sometimes quite long. There are notes saying they are working on them and directions on accessing the service elevators, but even that isn't always a help. Fortunately we were only on the seventh floor, so walking down was always an option, but only a necessity once. Hopefully they will get this improved, but even as it is, I'd stay there again. \n Locationwise, this place is wonderfully situated. Not only is it across from the great market, it is a very short walk to a major subway stop. An express train can get you to 42nd street in a matter of minutes. One block over, Amsterdam Ave has a multitude of eating places, and just a couple more blocks you're in Central Park. \n If I return to Manhattan one day, I will certainly check the Beacon for availability before I check elsewhere.", "author": {"username": "Stetsonz", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 4, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "63933F7C10F83E404F467EAD3A9B101F", "location": "Georgia"}, "date_stayed": "July 2007", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "date": "July 27, 2007", "id": 8243934, "via_mobile": false}

Also, requested new sheets, coffee, and a roll a way and all were met within minutes. Housekeeping was professional and flexiable with nappings and all the like that come when traveling with young kids.\nWe stayed in room 1911, which is a one bedroom. It was HUGE. The main room was 28 ft. x 16 ft., with a small kitchen (stove,oven,mircowave,full fridge, cups, glasses, toaster, etc.). There is a pull out bed along with a table and 3 chairs. The bedroom is also big 24 by 16 with a walk in closet. We were able to fit the crib in the closet, thus giving our children seperate rooms. THAT WAS GREAT.\nThe only caution i have is beware of the locals on the elevators, very rude. But it is NY.\nAlso, the hotel is a bit dated. Meaning the wall paper is old and so is some of the furniture. But in no way is it unclean or not comfortable. I felt this have the place some character. Nice break from the cookie cutter world we tend to live in these days.\nThere is a laundry room on the 7th floor, containing 8 very clean washers and 8 well kept dryers. Each cycle cost $1.75.\nThe location is awesome. 1,2,3 train is only a short 2 block walk. Fairway grocery is across the street, with excellent fresh produce and just about anything one would want. I read about the prices being high. NOT TRUE. With the kitchen in the room we saved big $$ eating breakfast, lunch, and a couple of dinners in the room.\nEats- Big Nick's on broadway is a must. Their menu is extensive. We don't eat meat and were delighted to find well over 20 vegetarian offerings. Also try the Pizza shop on Amsterdam, something and Peppers, can't recall the full name.\nThe park is about a 10 minute walk each way and worth it. For you will pass some truly beautiful brownstones. The Museum of Natural History is only about a 15 minute walk. For those of you with young kids in the park just after 81st street you will find the Dinana Ross Playground. Sand, fountain, swings (toddler and tire), and two huge playsets.

There are plenty of markets, restaurants and stores at all price levels and tastes. We had breakfast a few times at the Tasty Cafe near the subway station (Broadway and 72nd, I think). This is a counter service place, but the food is great and quick, and there is a used book seller that sets up his stand right outside the door who encouraged the kids to look through his wares.\nBecause the neighborhood is not as crowded and fast-paced as Midtown, we did not have to hold tightly onto our kids. The could enjoy looking around at a relaxed pace. Also, there is a fun playground with a Western theme at Amsterdam and 77th that my kids wanted to return to again and again.\nThe concierge staff were very helpful. (They were the ones who directed us to the playground). Anything they couldn't answer, they looked up quickly for us. We didn't use them for anything high-end, like getting theater tickets, so don't know how they would do with that. \nA small thing, but a nice surprise was the toiletries in the room.

Rooms are small; or the carpeting might be a little threadbare;\nor the elevators will be slow; or the staff might be rude. Or some combination of the above. It's simply what you have to expect in New York.\nBy those standards, the Beacon was fantastic for me. I only stayed one night, so I didn't have time to use my fully equipped kitchenette\n(a great feature). OK, the elevators were very slow, but I only experienced one wait longer than a couple of minutes. \nMy room was big -- much larger than other rooms I have had in the city. I lucked out with a 19th floor room on the southeastern corner,\nwith eastward views of the famous Dakota apartment building and a sliver of Central Park, and southern views toward Columbus Circle.\nThe room's furnishings weren't up-to-date and there were a few cigarette burns in the carpet. So what? If you want a \"design\" hotel you can look elsewhere. The a/c worked great, the bed was comfortable, the linens were clean, and so on. The room was huge and I had a sitting area with a table. This hotel even has a concierge, which is very rare for New York hotels in the moderate price range.\nThe Fairway supermarket across the street is amazing, and I am running out of superlatives to describe the Citarella gourmet market next door (even the website will make a foodie drool). A few blocks away you can shop at the famous Zabar's. One New Yorker (a client I visited while in town) told me this is the best area in Manhattan for food shopping. So you literally can cook gourmet meals in your room -- or simply reheat some of the wonderful goodies from across the street. That will stretch your dining budget and allow you to splurge on other meals while you're out on the town.\nI met a friend for dinner and spent $160 (for two) at an Argentinean steak restaurant. It was a good meal, but I would have had just as much fun shopping for gourmet food and wine with my friend, and dining in my room with its city views. And we would have spent half as much.\nEat breakfast at Big Nick's, a 24-hour Greek diner just up Broadway on the west side of the street. I enjoyed a great breakfast at an outdoor table.

The Beacon had lots of room and none of the madness of the giant chains. We were prepared to wait for the elevators, having read the reviews. They were slow, but we came and went at off times and only had one annoyingly long wait. We took the freight elevators from the second floor and that worked out just fine. The proximity to the subway is great and it was an easy trip to any part of town. We went all over and never changed trains more than once. We certainly got our money's worth with the 7 day unlimited ride metro card! The Fairway market is amazing. And there are many great restaurants within a few blocks.

The front desk was friendly and helpful as were the concierge/bell desk. Read reviews here so requested view room, stayed on the 23rd floor with a great view of the city and park in the distance. We were not too perturbed by slow elevators (also because of reviews). Got a pretty good deal on the website for a suite ($255 a night) which was huge by NYC standards. Two large rooms, the heat worked perfectly in both, nice kitchenette, small but clean polished stone bath. The older feel of the building truly made me feel at home and since all was clean, it was fine. Beds were okay, not too firm thank goodness, though a little bouncy perhaps. We arrived early and the staff were very very accomodating about holding our bags. The Fairway Market across the street is more than a \"neat little market\" - it's like a Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and international bazaar in one. I would have loved having it around when I lived in NYC and noticed many people taking cabs out of there with multiple bags. You could cook your own gourmet meals in the room with that kind of place so close, but why when there are so many wonderful and reasonable places to eat nearby (choices choices). We ate at San Luigi, an Italian place at 311 Amsterdam just one block over offering homemade pasta, very good bread, and other highly authentic Italian home cooking - pasta dishes for under $20, meat and fish for under $30. Excellent wine. Did I mention there's a Starbucks on the corner? Sit in the window for some really good people-watching.

Central park isn't far.. there is a lush store ([--] - bath products) nearby which really made me happy ..and the walk to the subway isn't bad either.\nI really like this part of town because it felt like families lived there... and riverside park is close by.. we walked there one early morning and saw a lot of people walking their dogs or jogging. Early mornings in NYC are soooo nice.\nThis is only my third time to go to NYC, but the first time I stayed in a swanky place in time square which of course was great and the second time we stayed in a youth hostel which was ok too... I feel like the beacon is somewhere in between. If you can get past the old decor of the room... you're set.\nI even asked the concierge once about where a good place for pizza would be and he directed me somewhere and was super friendly and nice.\nI'd stay here again for sure.

As you've heard from others, the neighborhood could not be better. The Upper West side has a great NY feel--visiting Times Square was a lot of fun, but I wouldn't want to be plopped right in the middle of it in a cramped and overpriced hotel room.\nSome other plusses--the Starbucks right next door, the great market across the street (that incidentally all you lymies like my husband had tons of English stuff including every English candy bar you could want!), was a five minute walk to the subway, and a ten minute walk to Central Park. My husband's a runner and ran every day there. \nThe hotel was much nicer than I expected.

We chose this having read many reviews from other Trip Advisor reviewers of various hotels. \nI have to say from the outset that we loved the location and the hotel itself and we were very impressed with the rooms (1 Bed Suite with Sitting Room & Kitchenette). They were huge and very clean. The bed-room included a walk in closet as did the hallway - very handy for stashing cases as well as clothes. The kitchenette is a nice feature although we didn't really use it much but the fridge is handy for storing water etc. Decor is a little dated being a bit flowery & patterned but unless you're a complete fusspot this is not a major concern. Rooms were cleaned daily and USA Today delivered to door every morning. \nLocation is excellent with the fairways market across the road for any necessities and the Manhattan diner 2 blocks north for breakfast and a Sarbucks virtually next door if you need it . The Beacon is also very close to the many restaurants etc on Columbus AvePrevious reporters here mentioned noise at night but we were on the 15th floor overlooking fairways and can tell you that we heard nothing! \nThe hotel itself doesn't have a bar or restaurant but that's not a concern for us as we never eat where we'er staying anyway. We prefer to get out and eat with the locals. The Beacon is just 3 blocks (3 mins) from 72nd St Subway which is served by the 1,2 & 3 lines. It's 2 stops to Columbus Circle and 4 stops from Times Square with Macy's on 34th St one stop further down the line at Penn Station. Too Handy! The same subway will also take you right down to lower manhattan and Ground Zero. \nAll in all a great place to stay and would recommend it to anybody.

A few tips: the fitness center was closed for renovation when we were there in late November of 2006. Wireless internet is available for $10/day; there's also an \"internet center\" on the second floor that we didn't use but I believe is free to guests who sign up to use it at the front desk.

Frankly, I was concerned the reviews were too good to be true, but TripAdvisor members proved correct once again.\nThe safe and comfortable Upper West Side residential location is truly perfect. A block from the subway, line one express stops at Times Square within 5-8 minutes - tops. We also took the same line all the way to the Staten Island Ferry at Battery Park. It is easy walking to Central Park and the Museum of Natural History. Tons of cafes, markets, etc., are all right out the door, as well as a Starbucks. We walked the area day and night, and never felt nervous or uneasy. \nTry Zabars famous gourmet market (turn right outside the door and walk for about four blocks then go across the street) for a truly delectable experience. The Fairway market, as others have said, is directly across the street for all your needs. We had a king room with kitchenette, and found deli/market food better than the cruise ship cuisine we'd just had. You'll find pharmacies, nail salons, and anything you might need very close by this hotel. We even attended the local church, which was lively and packed. \nThe room itself was clean and spacious. We were on the 16th floor with a basic city view - nothing special at all. No complaints there, as that is not a big deal for us. Ammenities within the hotel itself are minimal, but I did read there is a gym attached to it or something now (ground floor) for a $5.00 per use fee. With all the walking and carrying packages, you won't need it ! \nMy only \"complaint\" if you will is I could hear the people talking and their TV in the next room. The walls are on the thin side. It wasn't horrendous, but be aware if you are next to loud people or something, it could be a problem. It was not enough to deter us from staying again, however.\nThe double-decker hop on and off city sightseeing buses are an excellent way to get acquainted with New York. Be prepared to stay on two hours plus if you don't hop off. Start early, as they get crowded. We did the 48-hour ticket and it was perfect.

Nice, small kitchenette (microwave, toaster, two-burner stove, coffee maker, dishes and silverware provided by hotel) was great for us. I would recommend buying either napkins or paper towels at the grocery next door. The hotel even provides dish soap and a cloth/towel so you are able to wash your dishes. The room included two double beds, a tv, and a small table with 2 chairs making it just the right size for the four of us. Housekeeping cleaned the room daily and a newspaper was delivered everyday. The staff was very friendly and has a great map of the subway and bus system. I would highly recommend this, especially if you are unfamiliar with the subway lines as this map saved us. \nThe area around the hotel was under a lot of construction and after reading other reviews from this website, I requested a room high-up on a quiet floor. Even though we were on the market side on the 16th floor, the outside noise was still heard but by no means did it keep us awake or wake us up in the early morning. \nTo request this room, I called 2 days before we were scheduled to check-in and the hotel staff had no problem with this request.\nWe would stay here again if we were ever in New York City again. \nAs a side note, I went ahead and purchased tickets for the Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Museum of Natural History (including the Rose Center) over the internet before we left on vacation.

However, as far as the rooms at the Beacon go, each one has been a very different experience, none of them quite perfect. \nThere was the (rather small) king suite next to the elevator on the 22nd floor, views of Central Park, but... no running water (no bath, no toilet! nothing!) when we arrived.

We've traveled from the West Coast to New York City many times (our son lives in NYC), but, until this trip, we have never been satisfied with the lodging we've chosen.\nWe were very pleased overall with this hotel. We stayed 4 nights and were able to get a daily rate of $180 (plus the taxes, etc.) \nWe hoped to avoid the noisest and most congested parts of Manhattan and wanted to be near the 1 subway line. (I suppose it is 2 1/2 blocks from the hotel to the subway entrance, but it feels like a walk of one block). Other positives of our stay at the Beacon included:\n1. The location is superb - many others have covered this in their reviews.\n2. The hotel was very clean.\n3. The staff was friendly and professional. (This fact bears mentioning, because it is often not the case, in my experience; even in more expensive hotels in New York.)\n4. Our room was quite large by New York standards. (We had a standard room with 2 double beds and a kitchenette.)\n5. The room was remarkably quiet and peaceful (more on that below).\n6. The maid service was excellent. The first day we slept in due to a late arrival and the time change. We didn't leave the room until late afternoon. Nonetheless, the room was cleaned cheerfully at that hour. \n7. The kitchenette was adequately equipped and will allow you to have some meals in, if you wish. Fairway Market across the street has great produce (grocery items are overpriced) and it remains open until 1a.m., I think. Other markets are close by.\n8. We stayed during the heat of mid-summer. The air conditioning in our room was excellent. The room had its own heating/cooling unit. We could easily set the temperature (within one degree) and got nearly instant response. Room units do make a little noise, but it wasn't a problem (and, alas, I'm oversensitive to noise). \nWe knew we would be arriving late so we phoned early that day to request a quiet, non-smoking room, located high up in the hotel. (I also indicated that preference on the online reservation, but experience has taught me that often does no good at all.) The phone call worked: Our request was honored perfectly. We were on the 18th floor at the end of the hall and the entire floor was non-smoking. It was so nice to be able to return to the hotel to a quiet, cool room.\nThe hotel was old, but our room was upgraded substantially. Nice tile in the bathroom; new cupboards in the kitchenette. Yes, the carpet was old and the bedspreads looked as unappetizing as most hotel bedspreads, but we felt very comfortable in this room.\nNice folks in the lobby arranged a shuttle for us to Kennedy Airport. (This required cash. We were able to pay for almost everything else - except cabs - by credit card.) For those who don't know, you can travel from Kennedy or LaGuardia (I'm not sure about Newark) TO Manhattan for a fixed cab fee; but the trip BACK to the airport from Manhattan is on the meter if you take a cab.\nSmall problems: \n1. Another recent reviewer mentioned the raised marble step into the bathroom. This is not a good situation at all. We placed a stack of cardboard on the floor in front of this to prevent injury. (No joke, I'm sure this has caused broken or painfully bruised toes.)\n2. The beds were hard; not firm, but hard! This is a problem in lots of hotels (perhaps because this makes the mattresses last longer). I had to strip the bed, double up the bedspread and put it under the mattress pad and bottom sheet. That helped a little but was still not adequate. I realize this will not be a problem for all people. \n3. A nitpick, I suppose, but I wish management would allow late check outs. They were inflexible on this; which is ridiculous, because they obviously can not clean all the rooms at the same time. Also, they require you to check out in person in the lobby, without adequate staff. In my experience, most hotels provide some form of express check out (often through the TV's). Instead, we had to wait in a long line to check out. \nOverall, we were very happy with our stay at the Beacon Hotel and plan to stay there on future visits.

The Hotel Beacon was an excellent launching point for our daily and nightly journeys all over Manhattan.\nLocation is just about fifty yards from one of the main subway stops, 72nd and Broadway, and for seven dollars a day (until 3 am) or twenty four dollars for seven days, you can travel unlimited on the subways. We took the subway everywhere and felt very same at all hours of the day and night.\nSpecifics about the hotel:\nGreat points: LOCATION. Two blocks west of Central Park. Great neighborhood. Fine breakfast/lunch cafe next door, full liquor store/wine shoppe next door the other way and directly across the street from the Fairway, one of the few full service grocery stores in all of Manhattan. Also across the street from a parking garage which is $31 a day with a hotel stamp - otherwise it would be $40 a day. Rooms were bigger than I was expecting for NYC. We did have five people with each of my daughters agreeing to sleep on the floor on a sleeping bag one night each. We never told the hotel we had five people and never received any hassles. Concierge has great map of Manhattan and Subway system that was our bible to the city. We could get anywhere with our map and the subway and a little help from a lot of friendly New Yorkers. Kitchenette was handy. Refrigerated worked great - don't turn it up to the top setting unless you want your Milk and soda to freeze like ours did. One of my daughters used the stove top to cook some rice and we also used the toaster. It's a little hard for me to say the price was GREAT but compared to all the other hotels I researched, it was a bargain. Total Bill for three days including 30 minutes in the internet cafe ($5) and one day of in room high speed internetn service ($10) was $675 - hotel was $210 a night plus four more taxes added in. We found the concierge, front desk, and other staff members very helpful at all times and would not hesitate recommending the Hotel Beacon to anyone else\nCouple of small nits - I understand some of the concerns about the A/C. We kept it on High the whole time and were comfortable most of the time and it was in the mid 80's and humid in NYC during our stay. There is a small marble ledge leading up into the bathroom that I absolutely smashed my left foot into one morning. They should have some type of leveling plate on that. We just put a towel over it the rest of our stay so nobody else mashed a toe. Bathroom didn't have a fan and had poor ventilation so no to get too graphic here, we would send people to the 2nd floor public bathrooom if they had any real \"business\" to do as the whole room would otherwise smell. This was not a big inconvenience given all of the postives.\nSummary of our trip, in just 2.5 days we did more than five people humanly should including riding the Staten Island Ferry (it's free) past the Statue of LIberty, going up in the Empire State Building (not worth the cost or time), shopping and eating in Chinatown, visiting Ground Zero, now just called the \"WTC site\", saw both \"Chicago\" (fantastic) and \"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\" (hilarious) on Broadway, ate at a friends deli on Park Avenue, the girls shopped until they dropped at Century 21, H & B, Bloomingdales, Macy's, and all the wholesale shops on Broadway in the Garment District, ate great Pizza at three places, visited Times Square (our kid's favorite place) and sampled the night life in the West Village on Bleeker Street as well as getting crazy at Hogs and Heifers which is supposed to be the place that gave rise to the Coyote Ugly practice of dancing on the bar. Wild, wild place. Thank you everybody who bought us shots (I think) although staying out until 4 am made our ride back to Mississippi the next day a little more challenging.\nOverall we had a fantastic time and I thank Trip Advisor and all the other people who give their input into helping to make the trip such a success. I don't know what I'd do without Trip Advisor.\nBottomline, the Hotel Beacon met all of our expectations and we will most likely return sometime in the future.\nSteve and Beth Szabo\nJackson, Mississippi", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "date_stayed": "June 2006", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "date": "June 25, 2006", "id": 5382537, "via_mobile": false}

He almost turned inside out with excitement when he saw their collection and his mother and I were almost as pleased with the Beacon. It is a perfect home away from home for familties.\nPROS:\n - Easy walk from Central Park and the Museum, even for a 3 year old, plus a very nice public playground along the way. Safe, tree-lined streets. \n - $220 a night for a suite with a small kitchen. You can put the little one to bed, close the door, and the adults can have a drink or snack, or watch TV without disturbing him.\n - Fairway Market across the street. You can buy anything there ( I think they are open 24 hr). You can save major money and avoid the hassle of eating in a restaurant with a toddler and prepare all you need in your own kitchen.\n - I went out to buy a bottle of wine and strolled around the neighborhood a little. As other reviewers have said you do feel like a local. There are newsstands, curbside book vendors (at least on Sunday), and many small shops, bars and restaurants. Many trees, too.\n - The hotel lobby is clean and inviting, the staff was polite and efficient, we requested wineglasses be brought to the room and they arrived quickly. \nCONS:\n - None to speak of, really. Some might find the decor and architecture a bit dated but it is an old building and I found it reminiscent of the classy old days of NYC. Everything was very clean and no bugs, bed or otherwise.\n - My son had one disapointment, though. We went to the museum first and when we were walking into the hotel later he asked in a loud voice \"DO THEY HAVE DINOSAURS IN HERE TOO?\" He now thinks all big buildings in NYC should have dinosaur skeletons in them. The Beacon does not have any dinosaurs but does have everything else you need to relax and explore NYC.

To best conjure the perfect image, think dodgy seaside B&B in a backwash town circa 1970's and you have the Beacon interior.

Every major part of town is accessible from here, including Times Square, Staten Is Ferry, Brooklyn and Bronx. Central park is an easy 10 minute stroll. The neighbourhood has a more laid back feel than the hectic midtown areas, and with plenty of good eateries nearby it's a real winner.

We were there for 4 nights Feb 9-13 2006 and were thrilled to experience the biggest ever recorded snowfall in New York - 27 inches in Central Park!\nHad researched many hotels and reviews before booking and can confirm Beacon is one of best deals. Hotel clean, warm, heating works! Rooms massive - 2 double beds. Powerful shower with plenty of hot water at midnight when we arrived. Kitchenette etc all as per other reviews, great! Reception staff accommodating. We arrived late and although I had previously e-mailed to request non-smoking room these are allocated on arrival so we had smoking room 1st night. However, there was no evidence of its use as a smoking room - smell and condition of room no different to non-smoking room we were swiftly moved to for rest of our stay. So if arriving late would advise telephone beforehand. Don't use hotel phones - we didn't, but got a $5(\u00a33) phonecard which gave us over 3 hours uk landline calltime! You can use card in public hotel phones on 2nd floor. Once you have dialled number, you are told how much calltime you have. \nAlso bad idea to order takeout - massive pizza but as we'd ordered 2 bill was also massive! \nCitypass good value, everything in New York a must and of course impossible in one visit! Some of best times we had were in Manhatten Diner a couple of streets up from hotel on Broadway. Excellent food, value and well frequented by local residents!\nSubway great, we got 7 day pass as good value. Covers all of New York City. We had no problems using it late night as plenty of people still about. We also used AirTrain/subway link to travel to/from hotel/airport. No problems with traffic and cheapest transfer fare. However, elevators/lifts for AirTrain but not at other subway stations. Need cash for subway tickets as credit cards can only be verified if you are U.S. resident. \nClothes not generally cheap, best value Gap, Old Navy and Dave's (where you can get Levi's for under \u00a320). The latter 2 shops are virtually opposite each other on 6th Avenue (of the Americas) at 16th St. \nI managed to break my wrist ice-skating in Central Park but this didn't mar our stay.

The location is wonderful you are surrounded by shops\nand restaurants, it is a very short walk to the subway. We found the situation perfect after a long day walking in Manhattan in baking temperatures, we came back had a rest and a drink (nicely chilled in the fridge!)then just walked to a local restaurant of which there are loads covering every price range and taste. There is a very well stocked wine store two doors away and an excellent 24hr supermarket straight across the road. With regard to the hotel itself it is situated right on Broadway and it can suffer from traffic noise, delivery trucks and garbage collectors seemed to appear around 3am every morning. It seems to be the luck of the draw which room you get ours was on the 15th floor and consisted of two good sized beds and a small kitchen, with microwave, fridge( very useful!) cooker and kettle, plus bathroom and air conditioning. It is fair to say that the rooms do need updating, but they are perfectly adequate.\nTo summarise if you want a reasonable hotel in a convenient location this ideal. The kitchen is very useful especially for families on a budget you can get up to four people in one room which cuts down on costs.\nThere are no other facilities in the hotel, no bar or restaurant.\nWe would recommend this hotel and would stay there again, it depends on what your priorities are, incidentally we paid \u00a390 per night for a family of three which I thought was very good value.

But after having read the positive reviews we decided to go back and we are more than glad that we did so. The stay already started great when upon an e-mail send to the Beacon a while before our trip, we got a room as requested on one of the upper floors to the back of the hotel. Our room was on the 18th floor with a great view (we even caught a glimpse of Central Park). It was spacious and as many other reviewers we enjoyed the small kitchenette.

After a day of sightseeing in hectic and noisy \u201cdowntown\u201d Manhattan, we enjoyed to step from the subway and stroll around Broadway, Amsterdam and Columbus Ave. For breakfast we can not only recommend the upstairs bakery of the Fairway supermarket (as many other reviewers) but also the Viand Caf\u00e9 (connected to the hotel). From Monday through Friday they offer breakfast specials which we found reasonable priced and of good quality. \nWe really hope that the Beacon team keeps the standard and we will definitely choose the Beacon again.", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "date_stayed": "May 2005", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 24, "date": "June 26, 2005", "id": 3612295, "via_mobile": false}

The location is good if you want to get out of the hustle and bustle of midtown. It is a very short walk to the subway( I was expecting longer blocks). The area around the hotel seemed very safe even late at night walking back from the sub. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite located on the 11th floor at the back of the hotel. We didn't have a \"good view\", but that was ok since we didn't have to listen to the noise from the street. We had a LARGE storage closet located in the hallway with a hanging space at the rear, along with 2 other closets, one in the hall and one in bedroom. The bedroom had 2 double beds, and the living area had a regular size sofa bed, even though we were told it was a queen sofa. There was more than enough room for our clothes, etc. Having a kitchen was great, especially when traveling with teenagers who want to eat in the middle of the night. After checking into hotel, we walked across street to the Fairway Market and stocked up on snacks, drinks, and breakfast food. However, I don't recommend going there during the typical rush hour after work, it was horrible to try to find your items and check out. I had read one complaint about roaches, so I bought a box of large storage zip bags and stored all our food in them, along with keeping all food/drink items in the refrigerator (it was about 3/4 size of a regular refrigerator). The hotel supplies the dishwashing liquid, so I washed the things (glasses, flatware and a couple bowls/plates) I thought we would use and kept those in the refrigerator also. Turns out that the only bugs(2 small roaches) we saw were both in the bathroom.\nWe found the employees to be very helpful and quick to respond to request. We had to call once because the room above ours had some kind of leak over our tub area, and the maintenance man was up to our room in less than 5 minutes. They called us back to report what they had found and corrected. We were constantly asking for more bath towels, and they were always delivered in less than 5 minutes. Several times, we just left a note for the housekeeper to leave extra towels, and she left more than what we actually used.\nThe negative things about the room was the bathroom was not as clean as it could have been. There was a lot of mold in the tub--around the caulking where the tile met the tub, and in the corners going up the tile walls. So as a result, it made the whole tub/shower area feel dirty. The bathroom itself was very small; you cannot have more than 1 person at a time in there. The furniture in the living area was very old, and the upholstery was stained and grimy looking. The lighting was not as bright as it could have been, so we kept the windows wide open to help with the light. We paid $235 + taxes per night, which I thought was a little high, but with the extra space, it was worth it in the end. We had friends who stayed in the Times Square area last summer, who paid $195 + taxes per night, and their room was TINY. \nWe liked the location, the restaurants in the area were good, and would consider staying here again if I knew the furnture would be in better shape, along with a cleaner bathroom.", "author": {"username": "meikner", "num_cities": 20, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 19, "id": "7F63B6B3C377B7569CB49E83FC56B271", "location": "Humble, Texas"}, "date_stayed": "May 2005", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 13, "date": "June 7, 2005", "id": 3538038, "via_mobile": false}

The short summary is this hotel is junk for a couple, maybe suited to a family. It was my first trip to NYC and I got a cheap rate but to be honest would never stay here again, and would gladly pay more on my next visit for a better hotel.\nLobby: nice lobby. As soon as you get out to your floor the wallpaper shows its age, the doors to each room much be at least 20 years old (just the locks upgraded to a keycard system).\nRoom: the rooms are BIG, thats the only good point, if you have a child or another person it would be very easy to live comfortablt. It also has a mini kitchinette and microwave, which again is good if you want to save $, but when you are out and about in NYC, it's not worth catching the subway back from times square to heat up something..its new york..pretzels are $1, enjoy the city. Furthermore, there are alot of places around the hotel which have good food at all hours.\nLocation: upper west side: subway is approx 3 min walk to 72nd street, then you can catch an express train to times square. (one stop). There is a fairway supermarket across the road for water, snacks if you want. Plenty of restraunts around the neighbourhood. It's quieter than the midtown hustle and bustle which is sometimes a good thing.\nOther expieriences: When we got into the room, the safe didnt work. They sent up a tech who replaced the batteries. Unpack and settle down a bit, then we notice the bathroom has not been properly cleaned from the previous occupant (bins are unemptied, no shampoos or soaps). Called housekeeping to tell them, they said they would send someone up right away. As we were waiting, I wanted to turn the heater on, the heater didnt work. \nAfter 50 mins of waiting and calling housekeeping again, I was annoyed I wasted this time on my first trip to NYC and told them to forget it. I didn't even ask for a room change as the staff just didnt seem interested. Figured I would enjoy the great city and just sleep in this hotel.\nNext day early morning my room was made AND CLEANED and stocked. However I just bared it with the lack of heating.\nInternet: they offer internet, I checked mail the first day after being told to go to level 2 computer room. The next day at 1am I also wanted to check my email/flights, when I went to the front desk, this time I was told they charge $5 per half hour?? When I mentioned yesterday I was not asked, they chap said ok thats fine then he unlocked the pc room for me. So I don't know if he wanted to pocket $5 or what the system is.\nConclusion: This hotel is OK if you can get it for $125 a night..its not worth $1 more.\nThe only saving grace is if you have a family, then I can see how the kitchenette may benefit if you want do some cooking in the room. But for a couple there for 3 nights wanting to explore all of manhattan, this hotel is not all that its cracked up to be.

The room was rundown and dowdy. The size of the room was adequate, but the bathroom was small. Some may rate this hotel with high marks due to the kitchenette in every room.

And the rooms may be a bit larger than most other hotels in their class because they are converted apartments, I believe. (So, maybe not so dated after all). The location is excellent. For the parade, just a few blocks away from Central Park West (but get on the parade route by 6 AM to stake out your spot) and the Upper West Side is a great location, for walking, eating (and grazing). And you don't have to spend a fortune to eat in NYC. For example, there are several \"upper crust\" places for breakfast, brunch, etc.in the general neighborhood, such as Sarabeth's and Good Enough to Eat. But, also nearby (on 78th and Amsterdam) is a \"diner\" called Shining Star. We just had breakfast food and is was excellent on all accounts. Pancakes for $3.95--you can't beat that anywhere in the USA much less the Upper West Side. And they are open 24 hours, a full fledged diner. Plus. it may not be as \"fashionable\" as some of their neighbors, but it's still a place where neighborhood folks go, so you get plenty of NYC flavor too. Don't overlook this place. Also for cheap eats in the surrounding area: Fairway supermarket (and Cittarella's) are just across the street, an excellent Greek/Meditteranean place (Nikos is a few blocks away, and Zabar's (a NYC institution) at 80th and Broadway, both the corner cafe and the supermarket, with excellent appetizing counter and also prepared foods to go, fairly priced. And for great pastry try Le Pain Quotidien at 76th and Amsterdam, or 72nd and Columbus and, fantastic bakery at 90th and Broadway (Georgine's ???). As an alternative to Beacon Hotel, check out The Lucerne at 79th and Amsterdam (I posted a review there too). Both are excellent choices and values. Beacon rooms are a bit bigger and have the advantage of a refrigerator and microwave; Lucerne may be perceived as a \"step up\" in some guidebooks, but maybe only a fraction of a step (but no fridge). You'll do fine at either. Final note re. Beacon--I left my cell phone charger there. I called up, they located it and sent it back to me by Fed Ex--at no cost to me. That was nice and is representative of their hospitality.", "author": {"username": "mkatrack", "num_cities": 36, "num_helpful_votes": 193, "num_reviews": 52, "num_type_reviews": 21, "id": "BD4FDAC692918F7932DCAFD0C192BBE6", "location": "Albany, NY"}, "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 23, "date": "January 30, 2005", "id": 3099050, "via_mobile": false}

The 3 elevators were small and rustic, but expected from an older building. The hotel rooms were as described by most of the other TripAdvisor comments: suites were large with full kitchenette, two large TV's, temperature control AC, cable channels, etc. The only negative thing about the room is that the carpet should be changed - it was worn out. The restaurant (Viand) located next door to the hotel lobby entrance had a comprehensive menu and good food, and was very faily priced considering it is quasi connected to the hotel.\nThe hotel is conveniently located just 1 short block from the subway, which is not hard to navigate if you study the subway maps and map out your journey beforehand (if Hawaii people can use the subway, anyone can). The neighborhood is very comfortable with a lot of good restaurants, two gourmet type grocery stores and other specialty stores within walking distance.

It definitely is bigger than your budget NYC hotel room. Good size for the price. Didn't have a view but faced the sidestreet; didn't have any noise from the street like I've read. We slept well through the nights. Perhaps the rooms facing Broadway Avenue may have had more noise? The carpet looked a bit dingy. The beds were comfortable; firm. Small table with two chairs provided. Dresser with two larger drawers. TV with cable. Shades that you could roll up or down by simply pulling on a cord. AC worked well. Alarm clock available. Iron and board in small closet.\nKITCHENETTE: Microwave, electric stove, and small refrigerator. You also are provided with plates and utensils for four people. We made ourselves breakfast burritos each morning! In addition there is a nonstick pan, a couple of serving utensils, and a toaster! \nBATHROOM: Very small. Bathtub/shower combo. Not too much counterspace. Toilet with strong flush.\nSTAFF: Not overly friendly but then we're not ones to ask for a lot and complain.\nLOCATION: Upper West Side\nHOTEL BEACON NEIGHBORS: Fairway Market is right across the street and closes at 130am. You can get fruit, eggs, various meat, etc. If you're more interested in gourmet type groceries then you can head uptown to Zabar's which is about 7 blocks away (80th Street). Starbucks is practically next door on the right. Vivaldi cafe is literally next to the entrance. \nTRANSPORTATION: **SUBWAY**About a block and half from the subway, 2 minute walk; 72nd Street stop to be exact. Jump on the Red 1, 2, 3, or 9 line and that'll take you straight to Battery Park (South Ferry stop) if you go downtown with various stops such as Times Square and Columbus Circle (Central Park). **TAXI**Easy to hail a cab as soon as you step out on the sidewalk. \nRENOVATION: They are currently having some work done to update their really small lobby. Should be complete by midsummer. Noise is not bothersome. We were out all day and only really just pass through the lobby so the work being done was not a nuisance. They do have fairly quick elevators (3). \n**All in all, we would consider staying here again on our next visit although we would also consider trying out another more upscale hotel such as the Marriott or Sheraton just to see what a regular hotel room in this type of hotel would be like.

I'm pleased to report that it suited our needs very well. We selected this hotel on the strength of the many positive reviews we read on this website, and the favorable press is well-justified. The location is 75th and Broadway, and there are many amenities within the immediate area of the hotel: Grocery stores, pubs/bars, upscale eateries, family diners, budget fast food, drug and department stores--you name it. There are two subway stations within a short walk in opposite directions of the hotel, and you can get anywhere in Manhattan from there. The closet space is excellent, and the hotel, while not particuarly lavish, is certainly clean and well-managed. A minor negative is that we did hear some street noise even though we were on the 22nd floor, but then again that's pretty much par for the course in a city like NYC unless you're staying in some posh hotel. It wasn't so bad as to keep us awake, or anything of the sort. The simple fact is that this hotel a terrific choice for a family of four or less, particularly if young kids are in the picture. The kitchenette (complete with a stove and a good sized refrigerator/freezer) is a huge plus, and very hard to find in NYC hotels. We had breakfast in our room each morning, munching on all kinds of great stuff from the Fairway Market directly across the street. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at The Beacon again in the future.

I knew that my weekend would be free and I wanted to be closer to the culture of city. I really wanted to avoid the constant buzz and flash of Times Square, and the shuffling of money in the business and financial district. I finally chose the Hotel Beacon based on price and location. It's in a great location on the Upper West Side. They were offering a special on their one bedroom suites that I just couldn't pass up. It was well worth it because I had an excellent view of Central Park, a kitchen, and the rooms were quite large compared to most NYC hotels I have stayed in throughout the past. I had a one bedroom suite for only $180/nt and it had a kitchenette with all the dishes and everything I needed. I think the Beacon's regular rooms have kitchenettes too. I couldn't imagine being in a better location for what I needed. Just about everything I did while in the city I did it within a 10 block radius. I was right next to Lincoln Center, Museum of Natural History, Central Park, the Rose Center, and an abundance of food and entertainment for when the sun went down. The neighborhood felt very safe and the tree-lined streets were a very nice touch to top it off with. Overall, I couldnt imagine staying anywhere else in the city. However, my only complaint would be the lack of intrusive lights and sounds that used to interrupt my sleep before I found this place. I definitely expected to pay much more for such high ceilings, the marble bathroom, and all great staff.

I just got back from my first trip to New York and we all had a wonderful time. My daugher, my mother, her other granddaughter and I spent 9 nights at the Hotel Beacon. We were very very pleased. I booked this hotel on-line from the Hotel's web site after reading the reviews here at Trip Advisor and I was glad I did.The hotel staff was wonderful and very helpful. The room was clean and large with an average size very nice bathroom with a hair dryer. The room also had a small refrigerator, a microwave, a toaster, a coffee pot, and a 2-burner stove with pots and pans, plates, bowls, glasses, and silverware for four. For some reason there was not a spatula, so I don't know what you would do if you wanted to cook some eggs over-easy. Also, there is no ice available other than two small ice cube trays in the refrigerator. We did request two more trays that were brought up promptly. The Fairway (a very interesting grocery/deli store) was just across the street so we got some food for breakfasts and snacks. Zabars (another very interesting grocery/deli store) was about six blocks north.We were just a few short blocks from the subway which was very convenient. An Avis car rental location was just one block north. If you wanted a taxi generally it took a little longer to get one that was available around 9 a.m. One day we just gave up and walked the 11 blocks to where we wanted to go.Because we were in the upper West Side it was away from all the hustle and bustle of the Times Square area and other tourist areas. That was nice when it came time to go back to the hotel because it wasn't so crazy like other parts of the city and was very relaxing. We all felt very safe and well taken care of at the Beacon and the immediate area and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.I would suggest asking for a room above the 15th floor to help with traffic noise, etc. We were on the 10th floor and it wasn't too bad but it could possibly easily disturb someone not used to little slow due to them stopping on each floor (or so it seemed) to pick up or let off passengers.The next time I go to New York I will certainly be planning on staying back at the Hotel Beacon again.", "author": {"username": "TeddyTexas", "num_cities": 6, "num_helpful_votes": 30, "num_reviews": 6, "num_type_reviews": 6, "id": "77F5E37F215E881E19C9028AEA17634C", "location": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "date_stayed": "May 2004", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 13, "date": "May 30, 2003", "id": 1031775, "via_mobile": false}

Et bien oui! \nL'emplacement est id\u00e9al pour nous qui voulions visiter diff\u00e9rents quartiers de Manhattan en partant \u00e0 pied ou en m\u00e9tro tous les matins. La station de la 72th est \u00e0 100m. Le quartier alentours est tr\u00e8s calme, apparemment il s'agit d'un quartier de vrais new yorkais. Pour exemple le supermarch\u00e9 Fairway en face de l'h\u00f4tel ouvert 24/24 qui propose TOUT et chez qui viennent tous les gens du quartier. Id\u00e9al pour s'acheter de quoi faire son petit d\u00e9jeuner dans la kitchenette de la chambre.\nL'h\u00f4tel est d'un abord assez classe avec groom sympa \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e et lobby assez cosy. L'h\u00f4tel \u00e9tant apparemment habit\u00e9 par des gens \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e, on ne viendra rien vous demander pour porter vos bagages ou autres choses si vous ne le demandez pas. Par contre il y a une r\u00e9ception ouverte 24/24 avec service de r\u00e9servations pour choisir des spectacles.\nUn conseil : cet h\u00f4tel est desservi par une navette (shuttle) depuis l'a\u00e9roport : suivre l'indication \"GROUND TRANSPORTATION \" puis choisir la compagnie AIRLINK (surtout pas SuperShuttle, les vans bleus m'a dit le gars de l'h\u00f4tel!). Cela revient depuis JFK \u00e0 23\u20ac/pers bagages compris (plus le tip de 3-4$) alors qu'en taxi depuis JFK pour 3 personnes avec 4 bagages en tout on a pay\u00e9 75$.\nLa chambre : il s'agissait d'une suite avec lit KingSize . Elle faisait environ 50m\u00b2. Avec salle de bain avec wc et s\u00e8che cheveux. un petit hall avec placard penderie, coffre fort, table \u00e0 repasser et fer \u00e0 repasser. Une salle \u00e0 manger avec kitchenette \u00e9quip\u00e9e de cuisini\u00e8re + micro onde + cafeti\u00e8re + frigo, caf\u00e9 soluble fourni. Assiettes, trucs et bidules de cuisine fournis aussi mais en 4 exemplaires seulement (le nombre max de la chambre).\nDans la salle \u00e0 manger table ronde avec 4 chaises. D\u00e9co \u00e0 l'am\u00e9ricaine upper class.\nUne banquette lit avec literie correcte pour rester 12 jours sans mal au dos.\nune TV \u00e9cran blanc sans chaine francophone malheureusement , mais on l'a demand\u00e9 en partant... Ben oui faut bien un peu grogner on a un statut de fran\u00e7ais \u00e0 respecter! :)\nDans la chambre de 20m\u00b2, grand lit, TV et grand placard penderie.\nLe fen\u00eatres sont larges e,t miracle, on \u00e9tait cot\u00e9 Broadway, et pas un bruit! insonorisation parfaite sauf l\u00e9ger bruit ente les chambres qqfois. La vue depuis le 15ieme assez jolie sur les toits typiques new-yorkais.\nPour le d\u00e9part ils gardent gratuitement les bagages si on part apr\u00e8s le check-out de 12h00.\nLes draps sont chang\u00e9s quand on le souhaite. M\u00e9nage et changement de serviettes tous les jours. livraison de \"US Today\" devant la porte tous les matins (gratuit). \nEn conclusion : rien \u00e0 redire. 250$ / jour pour 3 (jusqu'\u00e0 4) dans un mini appart sans petit dej ni resto c'est semble-t-il un rapport qualit\u00e9 prix Excellent dans Manhattan.

Da meine Family aus NJ kommt bot sich nat\u00fcrlich an das wir unseren ersten gemeinsamen Urlaub auch ein paar Tage vorher noch in NY verbringen und wir uns in dem Get\u00fcmmel des Big Apple treiben lassen. Ecke 72 Stra\u00dfe befindet sich ein wunderbares Hotel von dem wir vorher noch nicht geh\u00f6rt hatten, es befindet sich genau neben dem gleichnamigen BeaconTheater in dem schon so einige Konzerte bekannter und nicht so bekannter K\u00fcnstler vollf\u00fchrt wurden. Wie praktisch daneben ist gleich ein Licour Shop in dem man sich f\u00fcr einen netten chilligen Abend das Bier kaufen kann das man dann im Hotelzimmereigenen K\u00fchlschrank kalt stellt um, so weit man es bekommen hat, bei einem k\u00fchlen Bier aus der warmen Badewanne auf die Stadt NY zu schauen und zu tr\u00e4umen... so erging es uns, in jeden Zimmer war ein Bad und wir hatten nun nicht nur das Gl\u00fcck das man uns im 10 Stock einquatiert hat sondern auch noch das unser Zimmer auf der Ecke lag, das Schlafzimmer zur einen, das bad zur anderen Seite. Man konnte so weit \u00fcber die Stadt und in die Stra\u00dfen NY gucken das man auch von dem Zimmer nur ins Schermen kam. Nat\u00fcrlich haben wir die mei\u00dfte Zeit auf und in den Stra\u00dfen NY verbracht aber es war nach einem echt langen ereignissreichen Tag einfach genial in dieses Hotel zu kommen. Personal war freundlich, preislich liegt das Hotel je nach Saison im mittleren Preissigment.

Gerne immer wieder....\u201d", "text": "Wir ( drei Erw. ) waren im Okt. 2008 im Hotel Beacon. Die Suite (Schlafraum / Wohnraum mit kleiner K\u00fcche ) war frisch und geschmackvoll renoviert und ansprechend m\u00f6bliert. Trotz der 18. Etage st\u00f6rt der Broadwayl\u00e4rm nachts ziemlich, also sind Ohrst\u00f6psel angesagt. Die Zimmer und Suiten werden t\u00e4glich perfekt gereinigt und eine t\u00e4gliche Tageszeitung ist Standard. Die Rezeptionsmitarbeiter sind jedoch unfreundlich, maulfaul und nicht hilfsbereit, alles geht nur gegen \"Dollars\". Wir durften am Abreisetag das Zimmer r\u00e4umen und 7 Stunden in der Lobby verbringen, obwohl die Suite nicht weitervergeben wurde. Toll ist die N\u00e4he des Central Parks u. der Museen, mit der U - Bahn kommt man \u00fcberall mit der g\u00fcnstigen Wochenkarte ( 25 $ ) hin. Achtung mit den Flughafentransporten: mehr als 55 $ incl Toll und Tip darf es nicht kosten. Teilweise werden 80 $ und mehr verlangt.....Ach so: Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist au\u00dfer den Wochenendtagen nebenan g\u00fcnstig und gut und sehr lecker isst man abends im Dallas BBQ in der 72 ten Str. 100 Meter vor dem Dakotahaus.\nWir hatten Room 1811 und empfehlen gerne und guten Gewissens weiter. Der Oktober ist eine tolle Reisezeit, wir waren schon mehrmals in NY, unter anderem im Juli / August, da h\u00e4lt man die Hitze und die vielen Menschen kaum aus. Sch\u00f6n ist auch die Vorweihnachtszeit ab Mitte / Ende November.", "author": {"username": "timpetu", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "AD80F20958C2B89904645F09D57FE474", "location": "Berlin"}, "date_stayed": "October 2008", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "October 12, 2008", "id": 20820123, "via_mobile": false}

Direkt dem Hotel gegen\u00fcber liegt ein Supermarkt. Dies ist umso praktischer, da viele (alle?) Zimmer des Hotels mit einer Kochnische ausgestattet sind. \nAuch eine Subway Station, wo die Linien 1, 2 und 3 verkehren, ist innerhalb von 5 Minuten zu Fu\u00df erreichbar. Die Gegend ist sehr belebt und erschien mir nicht gef\u00e4hrlich. \nVor dem Hotel liegt jedoch der viel befahrene Broadway, daher muss besonders bei offenem Fenster mit deutlicher L\u00e4rmbel\u00e4stigung gerechnet werden, auch durch die M\u00fcllabfuhr mitten in der Nacht. \nDer Central Park l\u00e4sst sich innerhalb von etwa 10 Minuten zu Fu\u00df erreichen. \nZimmer:\nWir hatten ein Doppelzimmer. Das Zimmer war ger\u00e4umig und recht gepflegt. Der Fernseher verf\u00fcgte \u00fcber weit mehr als 100 Programme. Zudem bestand die M\u00f6glichkeit, sich Filme auf das TV zu bestellen. Die Betten waren angenehm und bequem. Auch das Bad in einem sehr guten Zustand, inklusive Badewanne und auch ausreichend ger\u00e4umig. F\u00fcr New Yorker Verh\u00e4ltnisse ist die Zimmergr\u00f6\u00dfe auf einem sehr hohen Niveau.\nGeputzt wurde auch t\u00e4glich w\u00e4hrend unseres 10 t\u00e4gigen Aufenthalts.

Das Zimmer enth\u00e4lt jedoch eine Kochnische, zu welcher 2 Herdplatten, eine Mikrowelle, eine Kaffeemaschine, T\u00f6pfe, Besteck und Handt\u00fccher geh\u00f6ren. Bisweilen werden schmutzige T\u00f6pfe sogar von den Putzfrauen ges\u00e4ubert. \nZudem verf\u00fcgt das Zimmer \u00fcber einige Brosch\u00fcren/ Magazine zu New York, in welchen Tipps f\u00fcr Restaurants etc. gefunden werden k\u00f6nnen.\nEinziger Nachteil des Zimmers war die Klimaanlage/ Heizung, die doch sehr laut war und daher st\u00f6rend, wenn man schlafen wollte. Da es im M\u00e4rz noch sehr kalt war in New York (es lag Schnee), mussten wir sie \u00f6fters anstellen. \nUnser Zimmer lag gegen\u00fcber dem Fahrstuhl im 5. Stock, das st\u00f6rte uns aber nicht. Es gibt 3 Fahrst\u00fchle, von denen im M\u00e4rz teils einer, teils zwei gerade restauriert wurden, so dass man manchmal etwas warten musste. Der Fahrstuhl kam aber nach einigen Minuten.

Meine Frau und ich waren vom 13.08.06 - 23.08.06 dort. Das Hotel liegt in der Upper Westside am Broadway. Die Umgebung ist weniger hektisch und weniger laut als in Midtown, trotzdem keineswegs ab vom Schuss. Das umliegende reichhaltige Angebot an Restaurants und Gesch\u00e4ften l\u00e4dt zum Spazierengehen ein. Die U-Bahn ist 3 Minuten zu Fuss entfernt (72.Stra\u00dfe). Hier sollte man sich eine \u00fcberall erh\u00e4ltliche Metrocard besorgen ( 7 Tage - 24 $ ). Zum nahen Central Park braucht man 10 Minuten zu Fuss und die n\u00e4chste Bank mit Geldautomat oder zum Eintausch von Travellerschecks ist schr\u00e4g gegen\u00fcber. Klasse ist auch der gegen\u00fcber liegende Fairway-Supermarkt, wo man alles n\u00f6tige bis um 1 Uhr nachts einkaufen kann. Das dort herrschende Chaos ist gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig, daher sollte man besser nicht zur Feierabendzeit einkaufen. Die Zimmer des Hotels - wir hatten ein normales Doppelzimmer - verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber eine K\u00fcchenecke mit Microwelle, Herd, K\u00fchlschrank (Gefriergefahr ! - Butter morgens rausnehmen ), Kaffeemaschine, Geschirr und Besteck f\u00fcr 4 Personen. Weiterhin an Bord ist TV, 2 (!) Doppelbetten, Safe, begehbarer Kleiderschrank, gradm\u00e4\u00dfig einstellbare Klimaanlage sowie ein Badezimmer mit F\u00f6n. F\u00fcr die Steckdosen ist ein Adapter erforderlich wenn man europ\u00e4ische Ger\u00e4te betreiben will ( Akkuladeger\u00e4t, Handykabel z. B. ). Die Einrichtung ist pr\u00fcschig, also eher konservativ-amerikanischer Geschmack eben, aber nicht h\u00e4sslich. Das Publikum ist angenehm, meist amerikanische Familien. Unser Zimmer lag im 5. Stock, der Strassenl\u00e4rm war nicht sonderlich laut. Die Zimmer werden t\u00e4glich wirklich gut gereinigt, das Bettzeug und die Handt\u00fccher auf Wunsch t\u00e4glich gewechselt. Das gesamte Hotel macht einen sehr sauberen und gepflegten Eindruck. Morgens gibts gratis eine Tageszeitung (USA today) vor jedes Hotelzimmer. Das Personal ist freundlich und nett. Es gibt einen Concierge zur Buchung von Tickets ( Musical, Circle Line, usw. ) oder zum Buchen eines Flughafentransfers. Es gibt auch einen drahtlosen Internetzugang in jedem Zimmer sowie eine M\u00f6glichkeit zum Surfen an einem hoteleigenen PC. Das kostet allerdings 8,75 $ die halbe Stunde. Ein Tip hierzu, zum Beispiel zur Best\u00e4tigung des R\u00fcckfluges, ist der Applestore an der Ecke 5th Ave. / Central Park South, wo man sowieso oft landet (Glasskasten mit Treppe nach unten). Dort kann man bis sp\u00e4t abends an jedem PC unbegrenzt und gratis surfen. Restaurants gibt es in der N\u00e4he des Hotels reichlich. Eine Erfahrung ist auf jeden Fall \"Big Nick`s\" am Broadway ungef\u00e4hr 250 Meter nach Norden. Sehr leckere, gro\u00dfe Burger mit selbstgemachten Pommes zu kleinem Preis. Total hutzelig dort. Dabei laufen Dick und Doof-Filme und Oldies der 60er. Am besten drau\u00dfen sitzen. Klasse ist auch \"Emack & Bolios\" auf der Amsterdam Ave. Da gibts super Eis. Aber auch die sonstige K\u00fcche kommt in der N\u00e4he des Hotels nicht zu kurz.\nWir waren von dem Hotel und der Umgebung sehr angetan.\nDas Hotel bietet ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis, zumal die Zimmer im Vergleich zu anderen ( teureren ) New Yorker Hotels sehr gross sind. \nBei unserer n\u00e4chsten Reise nach New York werden wir das Beacon Hotel auf jeden Fall wieder ausw\u00e4hlen.", "author": {"username": "Schlauerdet", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "543AE05E5F2087D4DE66AC80112E6AEA", "location": "Nordrhein-Westfalen", "num_helpful_votes": 7}, "date_stayed": "August 2006", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 7, "date": "August 26, 2006", "id": 5711406, "via_mobile": false}
