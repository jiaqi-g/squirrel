Location aside, the hotel was very clean and well appointed. We had a room on the 11th floor, and after sending the hotel an email prior to our arrival they provided a room with a view of the Chrysler Building, as requested.\nThe room itself was a decent size, tidy bathroom with powerful shower and Molton Brown products. The hotel has two lifts servicing all floor, and we never had to wait for a lift. Both the concierge and the front desk staff were very helpful and courteous, as were the bell boys. A wonderful little touch was the urn in the reception area. In the morning it was full of coffee, with cups available for you to take out with you.

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.", "author": {"username": "9Adventuress", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "212787FEB4E7A223D38277943BCA6E55", "location": "Cockeysville, Maryland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 7, 2012", "id": 146977843, "via_mobile": false}

I chose it because of it's location to Times Square & 5th Avenue and because it also got good reviews here. The staff were very professional and always had a smile. The room was clean and cozy. Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs. If you are a light sleeper, BRING earplugs to New York! \nMy husband thought the room was a little small but I thought it was just right. When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. \nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot.

Its not trendy - its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well.\nThe location is great - two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven - or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue. 10 minute walk to Empire State.

The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC, the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests, they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations, they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet, and despite having to sleep at work, the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat.\nWe must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add!) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations. \nPatrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful. Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC.\nAMAZING.

Quality fittings, nice linen, new-looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries, with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room\n-wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC - could save you $20/day\n-room service menu is very limited, although food (from Triomphe, the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered. First room service menu I've seen that had no club sandwich and no fries !\n-the hotel has a tiny gym and sauna.

(44th between 5th and 6th ave).\nAs such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District.\nIf you don't mind the walk, Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over).\nWe however, found that many of the places we wanted to visit, required a short cab ride (Chelsea, West Village, Lincoln Center). Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive - plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days.\nIf you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life, this area is to be avoided. If you enjoy hustle and bustle - the centre of the action is right here. Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel - if you are at the front of the building, you need to be high up.\nWe stayed in two different rooms. The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor - it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room.\nThis room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out. The decor however, was extremely nice. \nWe extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor. This consisted of a lounge with two sofas, a desk and two armchairs, a chest of drawers, some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge. Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed, plus an armchair with footstool, a chaise long style bench, a chest of drawers, a couple of tables and another large TV. Also a very thin closet. The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes.\nWe loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in. I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house.\nOne major drawback for us, was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms. At some point in the past, the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room, leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps, picture spots etc). At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting! In our first room, we asked for an extra lamp - which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs, so not a complete solution.\nThe service in this hotel was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff. This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations.\nOther small but nice features of this hotel, are the switches on the back of the door, which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green, so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service.\nThe library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers, plus computers with internet. There is also free and speedy wifi throughout the hotel.\nWe would definitely stay again if we needed a comfortable bed in midtown again.", "author": {"username": "Rachel B", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "num_reviews": 13, "num_type_reviews": 4, "id": "981138B924BA850B9C6608A455712EAB", "location": "Hove, East Sussex"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "September 25, 2012", "id": 141293665, "via_mobile": false}

It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.\nStaff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.\nDuring our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.\nIn summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep.

What a wise decision it was! As mentioned in all other reviews the hotel is located 5 minutes from Times Square and Fifth Avenue making it ideal for any tourist.\nUpon arriving we were given the keys to our 11th floor room by Vanessa who was very friendly and always eager to help. The room was just brilliant. Whilst not the largest hotel room, it was perfectly sized for our needs and we found the view to be perfect and just what we wanted.\nAs it was our honeymoon, the Hotel staff had provided chocolate covered strawberries, chocolates, a bottle of wine and a nice congratulations letter. We thought this was a really nice gesture and started our trip off on a very positive note.\n Back to the room, The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was well laid out with a large amount of towels. The room doesn't come with a regular fridge as standard, it has a minibar style cooler which will charge you if you tamper with any of the contents however I believe a regular fridge can be provided if necessary. The rooms AC was a Godsend given how warm NY is this time of year. Walking back into the room after a scorching hot day was always a relief!\nEven if we had the do not disturb on the door, we would recieve a complimentary call in the evening asking if we would like our room cleaned later on anyway which is rare nowadays and a welcome choice.\nThe hotel staff, from front desk to the cleaners were all very polite and always eager to please. I would especially like to thank the three doormen we had most contact with; John, Carlos and Rocky. They opened doors, helped with our luggage and would hail cabs whenever we left on a day trip. \nThe only negative I could mention was the hotel only having one elevator. It's a minor complaint but staying on the 11th floor often meant we were waiting a little while on an elevator that wasn't packed full. As I said, a minor fault for a beautiful, comfortable and highly recommended hotel which we will DEFINITELY be staying at next time we travel to the Big Apple!

We arrived at 12 noon, too early to get into the rooms but the staff were very helpful; took our bags, gave us help with restaurant bookings, etc. We came back at around 5.45pm, were given room keys, and told the luggage would be sent straight up. The luggage took nearly 15 minutes to arrive and in fact I was on my way to get it when it arrived at the 3rd floor. I should have just taken it up myself. I then unpacked the things that I needed for 2 days, got into my bathrobe and went to have a shower - only to discover that there was no water. I phoned down to reception to be told how the shower worked. On trying again I then had to phone once again, as there really was no water. Someone was sent up, maybe 10 minutes later - but not a member of the front desk staff - some poor chap who couldn't fix the water and simply had to report back to reception. I phoned AGAIN as I still hadn't heard anything. The man came back with a new room key, but it was unclear as to whether this was my new room or somewhere to have a shower. He said he would move my stuff - but I was still in my bathrobe, due to go out in half an hour, and needed my stuff! So I ended up piling it all into a heap and moving it right then. On getting downstairs to reception I imparted my feelings and, of course, the staff were very apologetic. But my 'rest' time had been wrecked, and I just felt that the whole point of booking into a hotel like this was to avoid exactly this kind of problem. When I got back to my room there was a letter of apology and wine and chocolates, and an invitation to breakfast, which was a very nice gesture, but I'd have rather not have had the hassle.\nGood things - the bar in Triomphe was lovely, and the Lanterns Keep bar is really special. The location is fantastic. The staff are friendly and polite. Not so good - only one lift working, the wi-fi is a bit touch and go, and the rooms were comfortable (especially the bed), but very slightly shabby. The paintwork could do with renewing, and both the rooms I saw were very dark. There was no vanity mirror in the room I was moved to.\nI am aware that I sound extremely fussy, but I'm really not. I often stay in travelodges or similar and am very happy with it - but having splashed out to stay somewhere really speacial, I expected more for the money. I've stayed at 2 other hotels in the 'small luxury' range recently and they were both better experiences.

We were offered an upgrade to our room which we delinced as it was an extra $30 per night (we wanted to keep our money to spend) but it was nice to be offered.\nAfter reading a lot of the reviews on here i was worried about the size of the room as people mentioned the rooms were very small. We didnt find this the case, the room was a good size. it fitted us and our suitcases with room to move about. The next time we stay at this hotel i'd like to see what a bigger room has to offer but in our opinion the room was a good size. We stayed in room 805 (superior queen) the only thing i could fault with this room was the view from the window which was just a brick wall. It meant we didnt get much day light coming in and werent to sure what kind of weather it was outside but you dont go to New York to stay in your hotel room so it really didnt matter to us that much. The bathroom was lovely and the molton brown toiletries a really nice touch. The room has a safe which is a must for us and a large closet with iron and ironing board it also has a Dvd player and the hotel offers complementary dvds.\nWe didnt get a chance to speak to the Concierge much as he was always busy with other guests but we did ask what bar would be best to go watch the Scotland vs Usa football match and he directed us to a great bar. All of the staff in the iroquois were so friendly and helpful and coming in to a nightly turn down service after a long day sightseeing was so nice. \nWe will without doubt be staying at The Iroquois again!!!\np.s the libary has free internet :)", "author": {"username": "Gary T", "num_reviews": 7, "id": "2DF1AD0508CDAE3D7086C4594A0D5710", "location": "Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom", "num_helpful_votes": 1}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "June 1, 2012", "id": 131087906, "via_mobile": false}

I do not typically stay in the Times Square neighborhood because it is dirty, noisy, and crowded with tourists, but I had business meetings up and down the West side so for this trip it made sense. If you like to take public transportation, you can hardly get more central or accessible than Times Square. \nWhen I arrived I was greeted warmly and checked in efficiently, and throughout my stay the staff was friendly and helpful. My room was tiny and dark with one small window looking out into an air shaft, but not uncomfortable, and I had a nice and immaculately clean bathroom. The furniture and carpet are a bit outdated and worn, but not terribly so. The photos on the hotel's website seem to be a pretty accurate representation--one photo resembled my room almost exactly. For a solo traveler, my tiny room was fine, but it would be a bit tight for more than one person.\nAs a place to just come home and sleep--which is essentially what I did--the Iroquois was more than adequate. And for the price I paid, I felt it was a very good value. However, I was surprised to see when looking at their regular rates that a room like mine often sells for over $500/night. Had I paid $500 for this room I would have been outraged--this isn't a $500/night room, and honestly, charming as it is, in my opinion it's not a $500/night hotel. \nSo watch Expedia and other sites for good rates and if you are taking a trip to NY to see shows, this is a good home base for the right price.", "author": {"username": "TripsPlease", "num_cities": 32, "num_helpful_votes": 40, "num_reviews": 44, "num_type_reviews": 44, "id": "2B474233A1CC031A84C752C02DC28B6F", "location": "New York, NY"}, "date_stayed": "April 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "April 17, 2012", "id": 128050620, "via_mobile": false}

Don't get me wrong, it has all the appearances of being a great hotel on the surface, but there were a number of things that surprised me. The hotel is in a great location and is well maintained. Our king room was nice, but the view wasn't that great. The staff at the Lantern's Keep were a highlight of our one night stay.\nAll of that being said, the service leaves a lot to be desired. The check-in staff were not particularly friendly. Basically it was check-in and sign here. I don't recall even being asked if there was anything we needed. I figured it was an aberration and didn't think much of it and we went off to our room. Upon getting to our Executive King room, I was really dismayed at the lack of a view. I guessed wrongly in assuming the higher priced room would have a better view. I called down to the desk and asked if anything else was available. The person said she would check and call back. She called back and said that nothing was available and then proceeded to give me a NYC street geography lesson to justify the answer. There was no answer to my question if less expensive rooms had a better view. Is there an inverse relationship between view and room size? At least the person called back.\nMy wife and I decide to walk downstairs and catch a cab. We walk down the front steps without being acknowledged by the doorman, who is busy staring at the sidewalk. My wife proceeds into the street to hail a cab, where I can view the doorman at Sofitel and City Club hailing cabs for their guests. Our doorman is still staring at the ground until a 20-something woman pops up and \"grabs\" his attention. He proceeds at this point to practically go out of his way to help them in any way he can. Meanwhile, my wife is still waiting for a cab. Finally, I go to the front desk and ask if anyone can help us with a cab, which finally gets someone's attention. Another person, not the one who ignored us, tries to hail a cab, but then he tells us that it would likely be impossible to get a cab because of the shift change (which it turns out is probable) and suggest we find alternate means of transportation. We eventually give up and take the subway.\nOur room was a nice room. It was an ADA-compliant room according to the sign and had grab-bars near the lavatory and the tub. The odd thing was that it had a tub that a person in a wheelchair would be unlikely to use, since it had a sliding glass door and would appear to be relatively inaccessible to a disabled person. It's just my opinion, I'm sure it's legally compliant. \nThe deadbolt on the door would not latch. It turned when the door was open, so it appeared to be operational. However, the bolt would not move when the door was closed. It made us a little nervous, but we figured the security was good enough. Still, it was annoying for a relatively high-end hotel. \nThe thermostats are basically for show. The building is centrally controlled, so I think the thermostat does very little than open a valve for heating or cooling and perhaps controls a fan. We were comfortable, but I can't imagine what it's like on a warm day during winter.\nThe service issues cropped up again when we decided to check out. It was basically a repeat of the check-in process - \"What's your room number?\" and sign here. No question about our stay even though the other person handling check out for another guest asked repeatedly.\nDon't even get me started about the elevators. The sign explaining the situation with the elevators is just ridiculous. Spend the money and fix it. The current situation is annoying to the guests and must have an effect on the efficiency of the service and housekeeping staff.\nMy wife and I were trying to come up with a common denominator for our interactions with the staff and the best we could come up with was I guess we didn't look the part of an Iroquois guest. My wife and I are very casual people when we vacation even though we are well-ranked executives in both of our firms. We dress up when we have to, but dress down at any available chance. In all three cases, it appears that the person who was more well-dressed seemed to get more attention form the staff. My advice to the staff is my money is the same color of green as others and I tend to tip very well despite my t-shirt and jeans.\nAt least I got a free shoe shine.", "author": {"username": "rct225", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "num_reviews": 4, "num_type_reviews": 4, "id": "DA18F3AFE0102FE98D6DE109506EF448", "location": "Somerset, New Jersey"}, "date_stayed": "April 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "April 16, 2012", "id": 128013737, "via_mobile": false}

Flat screen TV, complimentary half bottle of wine, water, truffles (sign up for their executive program - it's free), and NY Times in the morning, free Wi-Fi. Huge bathroom, totally modern, with lovely tiles, Molton Brown goodies, and lots of fluffy white towels. The room was the super quiet - I never heard anyone next door, above or below. And the bed and pillows were just right. Nice desk area for working, a decent sized closet. OK, my view was of the fire escape, but that's pretty much all you get in NY, so I'm fine with that. If I want a view, I can go out into the street! I ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was fine - although I'd like a stronger cup of coffee and less salt in my eggs. The first night I had a drink in the restaurant bar and had the best Cosmo I've had in years. The staff are all super helpful and polite, with one possible exception - a group of us was in the front 'Library' room having a meeting and were told very abruptly and with no warning that we all had to move immediately as they had to set up for a dinner. It was 4pm, so we were herded into the restaurant bar, where all the employees seemed to make as much noise as they could. I'd assumed the 'Libary' was a public room as it had computers in it - and it was empty when we walked in. Aside from that one issue, it was a great stay. And I'd definitely put it high on my list for a return trip.

Decor is traditional but in good order.\nThe hotel has just 12 floors, (a cottage by NY standards) and we were on the top floor. The room was fairly small but quite clean & comfortable. Complimentary newspaper and free Wi-Fi was great plus an iPod docking station was available too. No tea or coffee making facilities but free coffee or hot apple punch available in the lobby. NY is known as the city that never sleeps and that sure is true. Even on the 12th floor there was an ever-present drone in the background. Bed was very comfortable though so not complaining.\nWhatever your taste there is a bar or restaurant nearby to suit you. For breakfast, the Red Flame Diner offers great value in a classic setting, perfect for people watching and just 20yds from the hotel.\nAnd so to the best bit - the hotel staff. Everyone at the Iroquois was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. Special mentions go to Alan the concierge plus Bill and Anwar in the lobby who's attentiveness could not be faulted.

It's a hotel bar-hopper's dream as well, since the Mansfield, Sofitel, Royalton, and Algonquin are on the same block. (The Algonquin is closed for renovation until at least May 2012.) The Bryant Park/42nd street subway station is a two-minute walk away, which allows access to several lines. Grand Central is slightly farther, but also has several other subway lines, so it's very easy to use public transportation from this starting point. I went all over the City and only used a cab once, and that was because it was late at night. \nThis is a small boutique hotel, so everything is compact and cozy, but they have done a remarkable job of keeping the character of this 1930's-era building while updating it for modern needs and expectations. The lobby is charming with marble floors, a chandelier, and dark walls. There's a small library facing the street with complimentary computer/printer access and a selection of newspapers. The lobby offers complimentary cider in the winter as well. Off to the right of the lobby is the restaurant Triomphe (which also provides the room service). It has a small bar area in the front, then a cozy, small dining room. I only had breakfast here so I can't comment on any other menus, but it was fast, done precisely to order, and very efficiently served. To the back of the lobby is the cocktail salon, Lantern's Keep. It is, as they say, a \"jewel box\" of a room done in a Paris salon style. The juices are all fresh-squeezed and there is a terrific selection of house-created cocktails on the menu served by fantastic bartenders who will chat while they work even though they're busy without missing a beat. A stop here is a must if you stay at the Iroquois, though they aren't kidding when they suggest reservations. With only a couple of dozen seats, it can fill up very quickly and once here, you won't be inclined to leave for a while. \nThe rooms are quite small, but space has been used efficiently. Tall leather headboards affixed to the wall give them a smart look and there is plenty of closet and drawer space. The beds are very comfortable. The mini-bar is a little pedestrian and it's one of those sensor-driven things, but at least the rooms are equipped with them. My bathroom seemed larger than those pictured on the website. The room was at the end of a hallway, so I thought perhaps the floor plan was a little different. Water temperature and pressure were great, which is a relief in an older building. Higher floors facing 44th St. have decent views of the block and some of the skyscrapers beyond--I requested one when I made my reservation and they took pains to ensure that at check-in. The rooms are equipped with DVD players and you will be provided with a password to the complimentary wi-fi when you check in. These extras are much-appreciated. \nFor me, the true 5-star hotels in New York are high-luxury places like the St. Regis, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Four Seasons. As a boutique property, the Iroquois is not equipped to provide the same range of options and level of room size/quality.

This came close but it wasn't perfect, I must admit. The hotel is quite unimpressive when you arrive.

There are limited facilities but there is free coffee in the lobby and iced water and there is a PC available for for free internet access. It gets better once you get to your room. True, they are on the small side (but you are in a city) and the view is non-existent, well it was from our room anyway. However, I was travelling with my mother and I had a lot of problems finding a hotel room with two double beds in a luxury hotel that didn't cost the earth. This had them, with fab linen and Molton Brown toiletries, all at a very reasonable $350 inc tax per night over Easter weekend. The room would have been better if they'd removed the enormous office style chair that was stuck between the two beds. I'm really not sure why it was there, unless they expected the bedside table to double as a desk. Obviously they did. The closet was small, but we were only there for 2 nights so it didn't matter. The room had everything we needed and the welcome plate of free pastries and cookies was a nice touch. The location is the best thing though.......just off 5th Ave and on a great block full of eating establishments, we were spoilt for choice and cancelled our pre-arranged reservations at Aquavit as a result. Note, there is a fantastic Indian on this street, something of a rarity in NYC. I've spent years traipsing all over the city, I won't do that again. We got so much more out of our 3 days by staying in this location. We did pop into the Royalton over the road which I liked a lot. It wasn't my mother's style though. The Algonquin is also on the same street, it's been taken over by Marriott and I don't know what it's like but, again, the location couldn't be more highly recommended.

My mum is quite disabled and can only walk a few steps but nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who were always genuinely friendly and gave you the impression they really did want to help. The rooms just ooze class, with immaculate reproduction edwardian style furniture, stylish decoration and several lamps to give a warm, cosy feel- a real home from home! All the mod cons are there too- free Wi-Fi, flat screen TV, an Ipod docking station with speakers, a DVD player with a free 200 + title DVD library in reception. Fabulous beds, beautifully clean and luxurious bathrooms, complimentary bathrobes, evening turndown service with proper european milk chocolstes left on the bed with a little weather forecast card for the next day, a safe and iron and ironing board mean everything you need is here. \nThere's a very good quality award winning restaurant in house (Triomphe), but we were on a limited budget so only ate there once. Most mornings we ate at the Red Flame, turn right out of the hotel and walk 50 yards- excellent, filling, good value no-frills food. The hotel location is just perfect- far enough away from Times Square to be quiet, but just a five minute walk to it when you want to see the bright lights and soak up the atmosphere! Radio City is just around the corner and the theares of Broadway are only 5-10 minutes walk away also. As others have mentioned, take the Gray Line tours at $54 for unlimited 48 hour use of their four most popular tours. Also, for cheaper theatre tickets on the day, go to the clearance ticket booths behind the seating stand in Times Square- they open from 11:00 for matinees and 15:00 for evening performances. \nOverall, this is probably the best hotel we've ever stayed in. For the price they charge for the rooms it's an absolute bargain!", "author": {"username": "Pompeydave", "num_cities": 8, "num_helpful_votes": 27, "num_reviews": 9, "num_type_reviews": 8, "id": "30850B7746EEF910D3C6BD0459B919EC", "location": "Portsmouth"}, "date_stayed": "August 2011", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "August 21, 2011", "id": 117020713, "via_mobile": false}

The hotel is surrounded by bigger, morer famous (and maybe infamous?) hotels, such as the Algonquin and the Sofitel, and they are so popular because of a terrific location between 5th and 6th Avenue, which is so handy for so much of the city.\nThe hotel has a fairly small and restrained lobby, but staff are friendly and helpful. There are two PCs in a library just off the lobby, one of which seemed to be free just about all the time. There is a ready supply in the lobby of iced water with lemon or other fruit. which always hit the mark on those baking hot days we were in and out of the hotel.\nOur rooms were on the 4th floor. They were clean and comfortable, though not particulary spcaious. They both looked out onto a fire escape, which made the rooms quiet, but also very gloomy. I guess that's normal in New York City, unless you have the funds for a high end hotel overlooking Central Park (I wish.....).\nJust after we arrived, the lights in one of the rooms failed for some reason, but a call to reception brought forth the repairman, who was with us in less than two minutes - pretty impressive. He fixed the problem and it didn't recur.\nThe free wireless worked pretty well in one room, but was fairly weak in the other. The restaurant looked like it had an interesting menu, but was maybe a little pricey for our needs. Indeed, the breakfast option seemed very overpriced at $19 or $20, but there are other decent places within a few yards of the hotel, so never fear.\nThis was out first time in NYC (from over the pond) and my wife and I and our two kids (21 and 18) adored the city and appreciated the hotel and its qualities.", "author": {"username": "CliveMilone", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "num_reviews": 7, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "63151814E8DDFD40C5FBB4EC9C591EF9", "location": "Brockenhurst, UK"}, "date_stayed": "July 2011", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "July 31, 2011", "id": 116076680, "via_mobile": false}

Quite simply some of the best cocktails we've ever had. \nWe stayed in a suite, which we felt was necessary considering we would be there five nights. This gave us some breathing room, and a calm place to escape the hustle and bustle of the city for a little while in the afternoon. The living room was well appointed, with a mini-bar, Bose i-Pod dock, sofa/love seat, desk, etc... The bedroom had ample space, and the king size bed was great. Only thing I would change would be to get a duvet for the bed in the summer time that is a little lighter as it got a bit warm for me at night. The air-conditioning worked very well, and it was in the 90s the whole time we were there. Noise from the street was inaudible most of the time.

I had read all the reviews on-line, which were positive, and knew it was a member of the Small Luxury Hotels Group, so I was not too surprised when we walked into the rather simple, small lobby. It is not a place to see and be seen; if you want that, try one of the many other large hotels in the area. It was clean, with a lived-in look. By that, I mean not modern or high-tech, and with the bonus of friendly not snobby staff.\nOur room had all the right moving parts, but it was very small. Aside from the welcome gift of fruit, nuts, and chocolates, there was a large flat screen TV, comfy bed, safe, mini-bar, desk, and a chair, but as two people we felt a bit cramped. We had to be creative about placing our suitcases in spaces that would not block anything. (One went into the closet, and the other behind the bathroom door.) There was free Wi-Fi, movie CDs at the front desk, and free morning newspaper of our choice. \nThe bathroom was very clean, and had Molton Brown bath products, plenty of Frette towels and robes, and a well-placed mag mirror. The shower was nice and strong, but when I showered late in the morning, it took a very long time for the hot water to come up. (My husband said his shower was fine.) There was a modern AC unit in the room that was efficient, but not silent. It did act as white noise to drown out the noise of the city, which is certainly a factor at certain times of the day no matter where you stay. Let me also say that because this is an older building, it is quiet. There was no flushing noise, loud echoes from the hallway, or sounds from next door in the middle of the night. Some of that can also be attributed to the lack of convention and large group clients, but it is certainly a plus.\nTriomphe, the restaurant connected to the hotel is lovely. We had pre-theatre dinner there one night, and enjoyed every bite. This highly rated small gem of a restaurant is soothing, with attentive service and a sophisticated french menu. We did not try their breakfast, but from the looks of the fresh-squeezed juice we saw when checking out, I think it would have been a treat.\nWould we go back, probably. I think we'd try to get a larger room, if it was not too expensive. Our rate was reasonable compared to other hotels, and we were not there to be in the room too much, but for the convenience. It is close to the subways, major shopping avenues, Broadway and many restaurants.

Another clerk readily fixed the snafu during my follow-up phone call. Second was the min-bar/fridge; items there are automatically charged to the room if you remove them for something like 15 seconds, whether or not you put them back.

Over two weeks, I've had to change rooms 3 times -- from a single king size to a suite for 3 people, to a single double thanks various commitments with friends and family -- all accomodated by the friendly staff. Nothing was a problem. The best? Of course, the James Dean Suite, 1950-1953!

Two small things: If you're a regular gym goer, I'm afraid this hotel will fall short in equipment, although it has a nice sit in sauna (2 treadmills, an elliptical, a limited number of freeweights, plus a Smith rack and a lat pulldown machine).

This request wasn't acted on immediately and we had to withstand this horrible odour for 3 nights before it was sort of fixed.\nThe new bar off the foyer is a great place for a drink before heading out at night and the staff in the bar were lovely and friendly.\nWe had requested the Iroquois to arrange a car to collect us from JKF on arrival which they did organise at a rate of $160.00 which we knew was excessive , but decided to use.\nWhat we were not informed of throughout our stay but until checkout was that we had also been charged $75 as a \"waiting around fee\" as our plane was a little late in arriving and collecting our bags took a while. \nWe were quite upset that we were never told that we would be charged this fee in the whole 9 days we spent at the hotel or that it wasn't communicated to us in the original email from the Iroquois after we had arranged the car through Alan in Concierge.\nWhen asked how much the Hotel was profitting from this charge, the concierge , Alan stammered his way though an unconvincing speech that the driver gets the whole amount whilst avoiding eye contact -I think his body action speaks for itself.

This is my first trip to New York and we realised quite early on that the location of the hotel was perfect. \nWe negotiated a good deal via e-mail and booked about 3 months or so in advance. \nOn arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the doorman who took care of our cases straight out of the taxi and on entering the hotel we were offered a slightly larger room for $30 a night which we declined. \nWe were located at the end of the 4th floor. The room itself was very small by hotel standards but did include all the amenities specified on the website.\nAfter the first night it was clear that either someone was smoking in the corridor or in one of the rooms on our floor and the smoke was either coming under the door or through the air conditioning. We went to reception the following morning to enquire whether the floor was solely non smoking and they advised it was but they did allow guests to smoke in the them on the 4th floor........what ????.....who was staying ont he floor the Sultan of Brunei or the president ????? Either they are non smoking or they're not. We were told that if it was \"bothering us that much\" then we could swap rooms. On the basis that it would have been a big hassle to move rooms and if we had have moved other smokers could be allowed to we declined.\nWe ended up putting towels around the bottoms of the doors to limit the cigarette smoke.\nWe are still in New York as we had plabbed on going to Atlantic City but the bus service was not running due to the snow. We decided not to opt for the $500+ for the additional night at the Iroquois and instead opted for the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Sqaure, where the rooms are rather larger and the reviews on trip advisor some what better.0\nGregorys coffee shop across the road serves great coffees and snacks.\nUsed the gym, although you have to call reception in advance to use the sauna. You also have to request ice as there is no ice machine....seems like a hassle to request to have the mini-bar emptied if you require use of the fridge. Why not ask in advance and let the guest decide ?\nDidn't use the restaurant, but did go to the Indian on 44th street towards 5th Avenue, was probably the best Indian I've had in the US, but not perfect.\nPros: Great nights sleep, nice bed, good location, dvd library, free internet and printing facility in the library.\nCons: The lifts are slow, they allow smoking in the non-smoking rooms/corridors, the shower was pretty poor as you had to have the tap running at the same time as the shower, bath didn't drain quick enough so showered in inches of water, toilet blocked on first day - sorted it myself.

Other hotels we have stayed at in the 4 star category such as The Michelangelo, London, NYC and the Regency offer larger rooms in the deluxe category for a similar price.\nBut, my biggest gripe was the negative interaction we had with the check in staff, particularly Alex.

We were told that they were full, and there were no other rooms. We were told that the previous guests in our room #504 had just checked out at 2:30 and the housekeepers were just now cleaning it. My husband said \"If check in time is 3:00 and the room was blocked out for us, why did these guests leave at 2:30. Alex said they had a late checkout and were late leaving the room. My husband said that if the room was blocked out why would they be given a late check out and Alex said \"Do you think we should never give anyone a late check out? Would you have us kick these guests out?\" This was not the point! His answer was certainly not apologetic and actually quite rude.

The small, compact reception is more reminiscent of a European boutique hotel,and service is of the usual standard you'd expect at this level of hotel.\nRoom 1002 seemed fairly typical of most rooms in the hotel - first and foremost, they are tiny! Even by European standards this was small - not a problem for a solo business traveller, but I would have enjoyed it a lot less had I been there with my wife.

The free in-room WiFi was quick to access and 100% reliable during my 3-day stay. Furnishings and extras are all of good quality. Morning coffee in reception and iced water in the evenings was a nice touch.\nThere are always a few gripes, which I'll list here:\n- although there are 2 elevators, one goes so slowly it's almost in reverse. During the morning rush, it could take a long time to get up and down the floors\n- the lack of visible staff late at night was unusual, and I did wonder what would stop one of midtown's less salubrious residents from pitching up for the night in the lobby. Didn't see any problems though.\n- no fridge was provided in the room - a tray of room-temperature minibar products were on the counter and a fridge had to be requested if required.

I usually stay at The Warwick (which I love) but wanted to be closer to theaters as my daughter and I were going to four shows over the weekend. I recently stayed at the nearby The Muse (and liked it) but decided to try The Iroquois based on recommendations from TA. BAD DECISION!!! The Iroquois is my first BAD hotel experience in NYC after years of visits. \nMy initial reaction to the hotel was disappointment - small lobby area, excrutiatingly slow elevators, and a miniscule room with virtually no daylight. I've heard about NYC hotel rooms like this but have never actually stayed in one before. I thought about upgrading our room but I found the hotel so depressing and uninviting that I knew we would spend as little time as possible in it so decided against it. Indeed, we left the hotel early each morning and returned late each night. \nBut that was still too much time spent at the hotel as I woke up covered in clusters of red raised bites. I showed the hotel manager the bites and she immediately moved us to an upgraded room and assured me the hotel would investigate. A different hotel manager called me on my cell after I had checked out to inform me that the room was checked for bedbugs and the report was negative. He suggested that the bites might be mosquito bites but I told him that they were definitely not mosquito bites - the location, pattern and symptoms of the bites are most consistent with flea bites but could also be spider bites.

I will start with the cons \u2013 sleeping was difficult because we were close to all the air conditioning units so they were noisy (even with ear plugs). It was dark and the lighting was appalling. You literally had to go around to each light to turn them on with no overhead light or central switch, we found it really difficult to turn off the bedside lamps so I unplugged mine each night. The lighting was so bad that I couldn\u2019t find anywhere to plug in the hairdryer and had to climb under the desk to unplug things. I later spotted a plug on the other wall! The furniture is too big for the room and a writing desk/chair is not needed. You can\u2019t turn off the air con/heating it\u2019s always on, but maybe that\u2019s an American feature? \nThe pros \u2013 the bed was great \u2013 new and very comfortable.

Not a massive issue but there is no place to keep suitcases etc.\nThe the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathrobes and Molton Brown toiletries were a nice touch.\nThe bonus for us was having free wi-fi in the room - you can also use the computer and printer in the library free of charge which is great if you need to print off boarding passes etc.\nWe ate at the Red Flame diner next to the hotel for breakfast and it was good - fast service and good selection. \nWe did the bus tours and went to Woodbury Common which is about 1hr away on a bus - it s a massive shopping outlet with a lot of big designer names - got a few bargains there.\nOverall had a good time, like the hotel but unfortunately got stuck and an airport hotel for an extra two nights due the latest volcanic ash cloud.", "author": {"username": "McCusk", "num_cities": 14, "num_helpful_votes": 14, "num_reviews": 19, "num_type_reviews": 14, "id": "25749634AE7A9B4DD760448BA0B1577A", "location": "Falkirk, Scotland"}, "date_stayed": "April 2010", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "May 7, 2010", "id": 63475821, "via_mobile": false}

I arrived at the hotel a bit early, and was told that no rooms were yet available, but they could hold my luggage for me (the wait was expected to be 30-45 minutes). I went into the library to print out boarding passes for the following day. While there, I spoke with two men who were traveling from Scotland and been stuck in New York for several days due to the Icelandic volcano eruption. They informed me that the hotel was full of people who could not leave due to the volcano, and I became a bit concerned that they wouldn't have a room for me. I went back out to the desk to speak with the very polite and courteous receptionist, who told me that they had a room for me. The bellman who accompanied me to my room was also very nice and attentive. \nI wasn't aware of it until we arrived at my room, but since the hotel was full they gave me a huge suite complete with living room, dining room, and kitchen. It was beautiful and far more than I'd paid for (my reservation was for a deluxe king room with breakfast included). I was stunned, but obviously quite happy with the turn of events. I thought it very professional that no mention was made of the room switch at the front desk (while other guests were waiting as well). While I have stayed at five star hotels that are much more plush for the same price, I think the nightly rate is comparable for a good location in New York. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from Times Square and all the theaters on Broadway. I was so close that I was able to walk to both dinner and the event (in heels) without paying a cab fare. That alone is worth a lot in my opinion. The bed was also wonderfully comfortable, and I appreciated the iPhone dock in the bedroom for charging my phone. The following day, my breakfast was delivered promptly at 7:00am as requested, and the bellman arranged for a flat-fee town car to take me to the airport (during rush hour). Everything from check-in to check-out went very smoothly, and all of the employees I encountered were extremely courteous. Customer service is the number one reason I will return to The Iroquois.

We had booked the standard room with 2 double beds which is also suitable for couple (just use one bed as it's big enough for English standards).

Extremely touristic but with good access to all sightseeing points. There is a restaurant next door but it was a little noisy and you needed a reservation so we did not eat here. The bar is nice though but closed on Sundays. There is a business centre where you can use the internet for free (they have 2 computers) and wi-fi in the room is also available at no charge. There is also a fitness centre but I didnt try this so I cant comment on that. We had room 408 on the very end, and the view was awful but then the building is in the middle of the street so unless you're on the top floor, the view would have been of other buildings anyway. The only thing that was a little annoying was that there was some sort of fan or airconditioning outside the window (not sure if this belonged to the hotel or the adjacent building) which was a little noisy at night. Nothing that was majorly disturbing but the bathroom was quieter than the bedroom at times.

The bathroom was well layed out with plenty of towels and a nice selection of Molton Brown toiletries (I had read alot of reviews about other hotels and one of the points seems to be around shower pressure - so I will be clear and say that the shower pressure was always very good in our room).\nThe room and hotel as a whole was always very clean and well maintained - even when we left the 'do not disturb 'sign on - they left a very nice note to explain why thye hadn't been in and were able to send someone straight away- despite it being early evening by the time we got back. The bed was very comfortable as mentioned in other reviews.\nThe location from our 'close to Times Square criteria' could not have been better - (The middle of Times Square is less than a 5 minute walk away). The Iroquois location was perfect for us and at no time did I feel unsafe walking around in the area.\nWe did not eat in the Hotel but I will assume that the food and service would have been equal to the rest of our experience in the hotel. Anyone who has read other Iroquois reviews would have read about the 'Red Flame Diner' - I can only reiterate that this place was perfect for breakfast and any other dining requirements you might have.\nThe gym and sauna was perfect for the short workout with a good running machine, cross-trainer and a selection of free weights to burn off any excess calories you hadn't already walked off. Again there were nice little touches here -fresh towels - TV - water fountain.\nThe other nice touches were the computers in the reading room connected to a printer (useful when doing on-line check-in) and the hotel umbrellas available in your room or readily from the door man when it was raining.\nIf I had to suggest one area for improvement it would be the need for Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room - though there was coffee available free from the lobby in the morning...it was the need for coffee on Sunday night when the coffee shop across the road was closed and room service was just too much trouble and a bit too pricey for Coffee on its own.\nOn the whole this was a perfect hotel for us - and if like me you have read lots of reviews to find the right one for your stay - Take a chance at the Iroquois as I feel it fully desreves it's listing under 'Small Luxury Hotels' of the world and I hope you will have the same great experience we have had.\nI would like to thank the staff at the Iroquois for making our first trip to NYC 'special' and look forward to staying there on our next visit.", "author": {"username": "Johnboy1402", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "Cardiff", "id": "1707484302C79890FD9E17B3C9D1E4F1"}, "date_stayed": "March 2010", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "March 17, 2010", "id": 58798762, "via_mobile": false}

After a full day of shopping, we re-sorted our bags in the Library, and were whisked to JFK airport by the hotel's limo service. Perfect from start to finish.\nReally, it is my only choice for where to stay while in New York city.", "author": {"username": "Goose62", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "location": "Muskoka", "id": "9CE2CAFCE0366F367BF1419D18D02876"}, "date_stayed": "December 2009", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "January 5, 2010", "id": 52676757, "via_mobile": false}

The rooms were spacious by New York standards, the bathrooms clean and comfortable, and having the middle lounge in the suite made for a great family time. We were in the city to take in holiday sites and shop so the Iroquois's location was perfect. I had searched for a Times Square area hotel in hopes of a room with a view, but was so thankful I had decided on the Iroquois without the hustle and bustle of the city just outside. The room was quiet which is unbelievable for a city hotel! Parking was also easy and the front desk held our bags both at check-in and check-out. We had the continental breakfast at the hotel which was a great start to a busy day. The offerings of fresh croissants, toasted bagels, granola, yogurt, fresh fruit and smoked salmon and cheeses pleased everyone.\nBecause the location is central to all we wanted to do, we did spend a bit of relaxation time in our suite. Staying at the Iroquois means you can shop 5th Avenue to Central Park, and return to rest before dinner and evening activities. It made for a nice break in a busy day. \nThe BEST thing about this hotel is the staff. It was so nice to speak with an in-house reservationist when booking so I certainly was able to arrange lodging as I wanted it - no compromises had to be made in booking the 2 bedroom suite I had requested. Check-in and check-out were flawless. We especially liked Nick, the concierge, who suggested fabulous restaurants within an easy walk. He knows exactly what you are looking for and works magic at getting reservations!!\nI agree with other posts that it is a bit of an annoyance to call for ice, but our request was quickly attended to. (and you have to agree that it is SO nice not to hear or see an ice machine around the corner). This is so minor to the wonderful ammenities, the helpful and courteous staff, and the great location that this hotel has to offer. The Iroquois truly is a hotel not to be missed.

It was the first time either of us had been to Manhattan and staying at the Iroquois couldn't have been more perfect. It's a great location, out of the way and quaint, yet just a very short walk from everything.\nWe had a standard king room and found the room size quite decent after reading how small NYC hotel rooms can be -- and honestly, if you're hanging out in your room while in NYC your doing it all wrong anyways -- just stay home. ;)\nThe hotel including our room was impeccable, the staff was very helpful, and the amenities were great. There is a great little hometown bar across the street and down the block 100 yards for when you just want to grab a nightcap -- this is where employees in the area go, cheap drinks & great people. We could have also had the nightcap at the bar in the hotel but wanted to mingle with the locals a little and got to do that which was great.\nOnly improvements I would make: (1) the high speed internet was a little spotty in the evening and (2) when you want ice you have to call the front desk. I assume it's because they don't want to waste the space for an ice machine room on each floor -- no big deal really, just kind of odd if you are used to staying in chain hotels.\nWe would (and will) stay at the Iroquois again.

I was impressed by the location between 5th and 6th Avenues since you don't feel like you are entering a bussling environment the moment you step out of the hotel. It is very close but has that classy distance so you feel like you are staying in NY but aren't actually in NY.\nThe residents of the hotel tend to be well heeled and well dressed who have travelled to NY a few times before and would like to see Broadway Shows and stroll down 5th Avenue. There aren't that many jeans and sneakers residents, saying that it is not at all pretention but you can tell people sneaking a look at your shoes when they see you in the elevator.\nThe hotel is a favourite for single travellers, especially female since it has a safe feel about it and thankfully no business travellers. Check-in for me was very smooth and the room although small was not small by NY standards.\nI took great pleasure in seeing the reassuring Molton Brown products which were generously replenished daily. There are robes and towels and interestingly a dvd player, you can get dvds from reception free of charge which is a nice touch.\nThere was a little office table in my room and no problem with the free wireless, the free wireless was an important freebie for me. For those not bringing their own laptop there are two terminals in the downstairs library area, there was not a queue for the terminals and owing to the class of people here they were just on and off the machines. Beds were comfortable, no problem sleeping.\nThe reception area has free coffee till about 10am and then hot apple cider which was wonderful. I didn't personally use the restaurant here but I suspect it was good quality.\nStaff are very friendly but give you your space and are always willing to look into for example opening hours for a shop for you. There is also a dedicated concierge.\nFor me this place was perfect, had I been travelling on business I may have preferred a place like the London NYC for the simple fact that it has an impressive entrance and obvious space for coffee and meetings. However, this is a different animal completely and caters for people who are not travelling with an expenses budget.\nAs for issues, the only issue I can see is only having 2 elevators, not a problem if you are on the lower floors since there is a staircase and I can't say this proved an problem for me.\nOverall I would recommend this hotel to you should you wish to spend a few days in a charming little hotel!", "author": {"username": "avelautham", "num_cities": 28, "num_helpful_votes": 59, "num_reviews": 55, "num_type_reviews": 44, "id": "77DEADF7B21A1ECA85BA20073E6E8C53", "location": "London, United Kingdom"}, "date_stayed": "December 2009", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "December 22, 2009", "id": 51667245, "via_mobile": false}

I was told at time of booking the corporate rate was Run of House and that \"we would receive the best room available\". this translated into what must have been the worst room in the hotel (room 307). It was TINY (about 2 feet larger around than the bed) and at the back, the windows faced right into the fire escape, with the next building very close. It was really horrible. We phoned to the front desk and they said they would move us, we moved to a much nicer room (rm. 1100), still fairly small, but it had a bay window and a beautiful view of the Chrystler building. So if they told me on the phone I was entitled to the best room available, why did they give me the worst room?\nThey make a big deal of their turn-down service with chocolates. We got this the first night. Teh second night it wasnt done. Immediately we checked to see if our \"do not disturb\" sign was on - it wasn't. It had been in the afternoon, but we tuned it off about 5:30 or 6pm. So either they just didnt do it or they tried to turn down our room before 6pm.\nI was very surprised the room had no coffee/tea making facilities. I drink tea and my partner drinks coffee. They had a coffee urn in the lobby in the mornings, no tea at any time, so we had to visit the coffee shop down the street.\nThe last morning we had breakfast in the hotel. We chose the self-serve buffet choice. They added a compulsory 18% tip to the bill and still added a line to the bill for us to add a tip. 18% tip for self-serve and they were looking for more? I found that a bit offensive.\nAs we left the bellhop asked how we were getting to the airport, we told him we were taking the skytrain to Newark. He tried to talk us out of it and to let him call us a car service, giving us all sorts of incorrect reasons not to take the skytrain (including that it took over an hour, that we would be hampered by subway repairs, etc - actually it is the fastest, lest expensive way to Newark and dosent have anything to do with the subway.)

It might as well have been the middle of the day with the service we received.\nWe were very hungry after our long day of travel and we were able to order some room service right when we got to our room, and it was delivered VERY quickly. I have to say, though, that $80 for some crabcakes and a burger was a little much for my taste, but we were STARVING!!!\nThe next morning we decided to visit the little cafe in the hotel lobby for breakfast. Again, the food was good, but the price was way too much. This would be the last meal we had in our hotel. One, because of the price, but also because there were so many great places around the hotel to get less expenssive food. I recommend this diner right on the corner by the hotel....I beleive it was called the red flame diner or something like that. It's really good whatever it is called, haha! We had breakfast there every day and you could tell it was alocal place that real New Yorkers went to. The prices were outstanding and you got A LOT of food.\nOverall, I think that this hotel provided an excellent place for my wife and I to enjoy our honeymoon and it was the cherry on top of our time in NYC.", "author": {"username": "Jsaxm", "num_cities": 16, "num_helpful_votes": 17, "num_reviews": 24, "num_type_reviews": 10, "id": "705A5757039FBC09AF6A9816C509F9DF", "location": "Chino Hills, California"}, "date_stayed": "August 2010", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "July 29, 2011", "id": 115986824, "via_mobile": false}

I'll get to the point:\nRooms - we stayed in a Classic with 2 double beds. Beds were comfy with lots of feather pillows. I prefer foam, but it was late & didn't bother to ask if they had that. Bed & bath linens were soft, comfy & plush. 2 spa slippers & 1 bath robe provided (nope, it stays with the hotel). Room & bathroom were very clean & with upgraded furniture, fixtures & tile. There was a good size safe in the closet. Flat screen TV, robobar (touch 1 item & it automatically charges, whether or not you took it out, so don't attempt to use this as a fridge). Pack & play was *free* for my toddler. We were told small fridge was also free, but it was not available for the 2 nights we were there. Turndown service with chocolates left on your pillow (they were good too). Our room was towards the back corner of the bldg, window had the fire escape stairs & faced the side windows of the bldg next door. At first, we were disappointed with no view, but upon coming back at 1 pm, found out we were fortunate as the garbage trucks came loudly in the wee hours of the morning, & the honking of the morning buslte was not something we'd like to wake up to so very early in the morning during vacation.\nKids - we have 2 boys, 8 & 2 y.o.; hotel has a kids amenities package that is again *free*. Just request it. Kids got a small cookie & fruit plate, a bathrobe & slippers (though it was adult size), a full size bottle of bubble bath (they got Disney Cars), & a pamphlet for NYC attractions for kids.\nInternet - worked well for us, but then again we used it after midnight so may not be a lot of folks online.\nParking - across the street from the hotel (Hippodrome). We were told it was $34.00 for 24 hours (don't know if tax incl) as long as you have it stamped by the hotel, but no in-out priviledge (we didn't use this). Parking garage had an overnight special of $10.00 if you come in after a certain time & it's good for 12 hours. My hubby still wanted his parking tkt stamped & we paid $9.00 (this is a steal in NYC!), still a $1 discount which went to the parking valet guy. By the way, we have a Honda minivan & parking garages typically charge extra for taller/longer vehicles, so the parking price was definitely a steal! At lunch time, we discovered that the parking meters & places I used to park at years ago are long gone, so we paid $20.00 for 1 hour at a parking garage near Madison & Grand Central, but still cheaper than getting your car towed.\nLost & found - not so good part. We thought we left someone important for our toddler & called 4 times Monday, the housekeeper took my info & asked me to call back in 15 minutes.

Tuesday, houseman took my item & contact info & said he will have supv call as lost & found items are locked in the office, didn't hear from anyone. Wednesday, called & asked to speak to the hskp supv to whom I explained my several attempts of getting in touch with Lost & Found, & who again took my info, said she'll check & call me back. After 3 hours, I called again & spoke to the same hskp supv who said they didn't find anything. I asked why she didn't call me back & she said she was busy, no apologies. I replied that I wished she had called me back, that would just be good customer service after all my attempts to call for the past 3 days. I believe that customer service should be extended to the guest even after they've checked out. For this, I took 1 star off.\nOther than that, we liked this hotel & would stay again.

Rooms were clean but the hotel and room shows its age. Rough spots in the arm chair and corners of walls. Hotel elevator is terribly slow and there are only two. Bathroom and bedroom was small but that's expected in most New York hotels. I had a rough experience with the check in staff. The lady who checked me in was clearly foreign so I had trouble understanding her. After a long trip to New York I wasn't very patient. Rooms are dimly lit--only lamps no ceiling lights. There aren't enough outlets here especially when you have electronics like a laptop, cellphone, ipod etc.\nThe Good: The price is reasonable for New York. Maid service was good in cleaning and provided fresh towels every day. For kids, the hotel has a bunch of DVDs for rent that you can use in the DVD player they provide. Free wireless internet was wonderful and fast. There was a computer and printer in the small hotel library which was good for printing out boarding passes. The bell hop and desk staff were generally friendly except the lady mentioned above. The beds were very comfortable as were the sheets. I had a 6:30 pm flight but there is a luggage storage room that the hotel provides which was very helpful because they have a 12pm check out time. The halls are nice and quiet at night and during the day making it a perfect place to relax after a long day in the city. \nThe location is very good. Close to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Bryant Park and the New York Public Library and Rockefeller Center. The B,D,F,V train is close by at 42nd street and 6th Avenue. If you want a cab, it's reasonable going from 44th street to anywhere. I went to the Upper East Side at 96th street for under $10 and the same when I went to Greenwich Village. \nI did not try the hotel's restaurant, Triomphe, or room service. From my walks around the area I didn't find a lot of restaurants. There isn't as many as in Greenwich Village or the Upper West Side, so count on leaving the area for lunch or dinner. \nI would come back to the Iroquois for my next trip. Reasonable price.

Couldn't have asked for anything better, 1.5 blocks from Times Square, literally a 5 minute walk. A lovely street just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.\nThe Red Flame diner is a few doors down and like many have said in reviews it really is the best diner for breakfast. We went there most mornings before we set off for our day.\nHOTEL\nFree internet access in the reception which we never had to que for. Recepetion were helpful and helped with any requests we had. Always said good morning etc.\nOur room was small but we were expecting this as everyone says it, small really is small!\nThere was no view, unless you love walls! on our first morning we walked past an open room that was being cleaned and looked much bigger and brighter so we asked the maid if we could move! Recpetion said it was no problem and would be a little extra for the week, we were happy to pay this, we moved everything over and were much happier.\nThe size of the room really isn't important as you are up and out so early and back late it really is just somewhere to sleep. The toiletries were lovely, molton brown and were replenished daily as were towels.\nWe had no complaints.\nGetting around.\nNew York is so easy to get around, we were so surprised. We had booked a tour with Real New York Tours thinking we'd never find anything but this tour wasn't until our 3rd day. To our surprise in our first couple of days we'd done miles and found it so easy we were worried we'd wasted money on a tour.\nTours\nFor people thinking of booking Real New Tours or one similar my advice is to book this at the beginning of your stay ie day 1 or 2. Any later and i don't think it's worth the money. \nOurs was a half day and yes it was really interesting and the guide was lovely but we could have done it on our own in hindsight. She did take us to Harlem which we wouldn't have done on our own and took me to Carrie's house :0 ) which again, i wouldn't have found on my own! Just book it for your first days there.\nThings to do.\n1.WTC Museum Workshop\nGo. Worth every penny. Extremely moving. Would highly recommend. 12/10\n2.Ellis island\nReally enjoyed, more than we thought actually. Don't do the statue of liberty as a seperate trip unless you really want to get off and climb it, the boat to Ellis stops to let people off at Liberty Island so you get a really good look and plenty of photo opps. The boat goes right round too so in my opinion not worth the extra \u00a3\u00a3\n3.Empire State\nWorth doing, wanted to do it to say we'd done it, view was well worth the que!\n4.Chelsea Market\nReally liked it hear, smaller than i thought it was. Stop for chinese, lovely.\n5.Grenwich Village\nLoved walking about here. Friends building, SATC Carrie's house and of course Magnolia bakery-stop for a cupcake or 2, there lovely.\nHad an amazing time and will definatley be back! x\nBroadway\nWe went to see Mary Poppins and it was out of this world. Go and see it you'll love it! We're in our 30's and sat grinning like cheshire cats on the 1st row! Brilliant.\ni booked tickets through www.broadwaybox.com and good a good price and got front seats even though it was only 2 weeks before the show.\nEating\nRed Flame for breakfasts\nJohn's for pizza.......best pizza ever!\nSerendipidy's....we went twice, my b/f loved it!

It is only about two blocks from the small, but beautiful Bryant Park. The taxi ride from JFK is a flat $45 plus $5 toll and tip. It is a relatively small hotel sharing a narrow street with the Sofitel and another hotels as well as a diner and a few restaurants, including the Triomphe which is the hotel's restaurant and where room service comes from. \nI cannot comment on the food because I did not eat any of it. However, the Triomphe was rated high by Zagat (average of about 23 or so). The Internet worked intermittently, but no different from anywhere else in the USA. \nThe staff were uncaring and barely helpful. Also, when the doorman opened the door for us I overheard him saying to another staff member, \"You know Jose only made $20 in tips?\" That is just not classy. At night, there was no staff at the desk or no doorman, so security is a bit of a concern. There was a video camera installed in the elevator, but I think people can use the staircase from the first floor. The guy who was there at night was not very friendly or even really tried to be helpful. The concierge was only seen a few times during the day.\nThe deluxe room was very nice with an old New York feel to it. However, it was a bit cramped New York-style, too. When you go use the toilet and leave the door open, for example, you have to pee sideways because the door blocks your way. Also, the shower/bathtub is an older type in which you need to pull all the way to get proper water pressure and then push a metal stick to have the water come out of the showerhead. The bathroom amenities were alright though. Our rooms faced the courtyard which had a noisy airconditioning system or some kind of machine that hummed loudly all day. The lobby is like a mix between a classic New York pub and someone's living room (there is a den with computer).\nThe price of the hotel jumped up to double when we tried to add extra nights. So I think we got a very good deal. The manager was helpful and negotiated a lower rate for us which was nice of her. \nSUMMARY: This is a four star hotel in quality of the rooms, but I think the service could be much better. It was really lacking when we were there and so I want to give this hotel three and a half stars overall.

Looking back, I am quite amazed that not one hotel that I visited prior to the Iroquois was able to match each of my preferences (in some cases, not even half of them!). Given the sprawling, crowded environment of many of the larger NYC hotels that I previously endured, I have become especially fond of the Iroquois' cozy, intimate setting that allows the staff the opportunity to assist on a more personal basis with their guests. That the hotel staff always remembers me by name whenever I return (and I have also seen this with many other visitors) and goes out of their way to make me feel welcome without being intrusive is an absolute luxury - especially when i am over 2,000 miles away from home!", "author": {"username": "melsli77", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "AE35636B88C78999670311200CF0E958", "location": "Los Angeles, California", "num_helpful_votes": 7}, "date_stayed": "February 2009", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 7, "date": "April 7, 2009", "id": 27591191, "via_mobile": false}

Those that we bought were different sizes than those provided in the room, and the water was a different brand entirely.

These two minor details ended an otherwise wonderful stay on a less than perfect note, but otherwise, we loved the hotel and had no other complaints.

I reported all but the soiled sink (which I wiped down myself). The phone and tub were fixed by the next day, but not the make-up mirror. On the second morning, a random extra box of hand soap was left atop the minibar, where it remained despite at least a couple more housekeeping visits. Curiously too, housekeeping seemed compelled to turn one set of blinds up and one set down when closing them at the end of each day. And the decorative bolster pillow, which during the day rested atop the bed pillows, was placed on the floor during turndown \u2013 again, yuck.\nOne last note, which is meant only to be factual and not critical: If you need to be able to personally control your HVAC, this is not the place for you. The system is set to heat during the cold months and despite setting the thermostat to 68 degrees, the room temp nonetheless hovered at around 73, a little to warm to be under a down comforter on even most winter nights.

The staff was very nice except a guy at the front desk I believe his name was Antonio he seemed very condescending and fake (this is the way I could describe his manner) not the kind of service I'd expect from this kind of hotel. Also they do not offer 24hr room service as advertised I called down for food and they told me it would take 45 minutes I asked why so long and they told me they had to order it from a diner and it gets delivered to the front desk. When I finally received my food it wasn't it warm never mind hot and it was horrible food not what I would expect from a \"4 star\" hotel but they still charged me like it was even though I could have just as well ordered it myself and saved money. The only thing good about this place was the bellmen (who were very friendly every time I went in and out and really had personality they didn't seem to be putting on an act) and the hot cider in the lobby otherwise avoid this place!!!!!!!!!!", "author": {"username": "welltraveled617", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "BA732B0EC5308BA8C7FCAD4956019AA9", "location": "Arizona", "num_helpful_votes": 2}, "date_stayed": "December 2008", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "January 22, 2009", "id": 23779142, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed one night in the Classic and it was quite adequate-- clean, a good size for a NYC hotel room. Comfortable bed, fluffy towels and bathrobes and quiet. I didn't hear any noise in the hallway or from other rooms. The Suite was heavenly with a spacious living room, sofa set, desk, flat screen TV, BOSE mp3 player, complimentary half bottle of wine and sparkling water. Once again, exceptionally clean surroundings with that incredibly comfortable bed, flat screen TVr; marble bathroom with separate shower and jacuzzi tub. Turndown service was consistent with chocolates and weather card. There's a wonderful complimentary shoe shine service and that person does a great job!! We did attempt to order room service one morning and our card was not picked up; the next morning, however, breakfast was delivered promptly. Reasonable price for that breakfast, too. The entire staff is professional and pleasant. There's coffee available in the main lobby in the mornings and I could honestly say, that renovation of that lobby is finished (to give an update based on other travelers' info).

When we arrived we were greeted by a reception area that was in the middle of being refurbished (the hotel conveniently managed to omit this during any booking conversation). First impressions count and needless to say this did not help one bit. The check-in was smooth and the staff friendly and our next experience was the antique elevators, very slow, very dated and very tired. Then the room, whilst it was tidy and clean the decor was also tired but the overwhelming lasting impression is the size, or lack of as the case may be. The bed dominates the room with just enough space to walk around and there was certainly not enough cupboard space to accomodate my wife and my self never mind store any bags/cases out of the way. Now I do not claim to be an experienced New York visitor and I was aware that hotel rooms in midtown Manhattan are small but was not prepared for just how small. We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking 44th streat which was a bonus as I think that if we had been given a room at the back facing a brick wall or AC unit I would have turned around and walked out. The bathroom was reasonably well appointed with everything that you would expect. The room was furnished with most of the conveniences that you would expect from a deluxe/superior room; safe, iron/board, mini-bar, wifi internet access, wide screen TV etc but did not have any tea/coffee making facilities!? The room was serviced well with no complaints on that front . The hotel has a bar/restaurant called Triomphe attached and whilst the bar was small and friendly the food wasn't great by NY standards.\nOverall the biggest positive that this hotel has is the location. It's situated on West 44th between 5th and 6th Avenues and is a stones throw from some of the main NY attractions. However the hotel advertises itself as a boutique hotel with the obvious French theme and states 4 star rating and an entry on the Small Luxury Hotels of the world. At one point in time this may have been the case but unfortunately not now. The decor was old and tired and the boutique theme lost somewhere in translation. It tries hard with Molten Brown products in the bathroom and decent towels and linen but doesn't really come up to scratch I'm afraid. Certainly not for the prices they are charging.\nI don't have any major complaints about the hotel but there is definately better value for money even on the same street as the hotel is located directly next to the Sofitel and straight across the road from the Royalton which both looked more spacious and better appointed.\nWhilst we enjoyed our time in NY it's unlikely that we'll stay here in future.", "author": {"username": "Northernpar", "num_cities": 4, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "num_reviews": 4, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "7A288C51642D9C438B0B67743791F8DB", "location": "Aberdeen, Scotland, UK"}, "date_stayed": "August 2008", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 4, 2008", "id": 19753250, "via_mobile": false}

Our room which although wasn't huge, was very comfy, with a stunning marble bathroom and molten brown toiletries, which were regularly replaced. After a long day in the city, to come back and have our beds made and chocolates left on our pillow as part of turndown service, was great for us. The staff, as other people have said on here, are what really adds to this hotel. Friendly and pleased to help you. Complimentary Coffee at the lobby every morning from 7 AM to 10 AM Is a big pulse( I would start it at 6Am for the Jetlag suffers). And a cold lemonade for rest of the day. The hotel is well situated, close to the show we attended. close to times square, and the subway is a block away. It clearly has an European flavor to it, small but complete. It's a great location.\nAll in all, we would definitely go back!

The stay started badly as I arrived on a parade day, had some trouble walking to the hotel from the bus drop off at Grand Central due to road closures but finally made it there a little after 2 pm. I was told the room was not ready yet, that check-in was at 3 pm and that I could upgrade and have a room immediately if I wanted. I declined the option to upgrade and opted to wait out the hour till check-in by leaving my luggage with the hotel and going shopping. I returned at 3:30 pm or so, checked into my room, went up to my room and waited for my luggage. It took a while and finally my suitcase was delivered but not my carry-on. It turns out that another departing guest had taken my luggage by mistake through a series of bad luck occurrences - she sent her friend to retrieve her carry-on, her friend did not know what it looked like and did not have a claim slip, chose my carry-on by mistake eventhough it was nothing like her friend's and rushed out with it. I spent an anxious hour or so waiting for the other guest to return from the airport with my carry-on as I was worried about the personal information and contents of my carry-on. In the end everything worked out, the lady returned from JFK having missed her flight but with my carry-on to exchange for her correct one, and nothing was missing from my carry-on. The hotel staff were most apologetic. Front-desk offered a couple of free drinks coupon, the manager responded to an e-mail I sent about the incident and assured me their procedures were being reviewed to prevent another such incident and offered a stay in a suite at their best available price next time. The most touching though was the effort from the bellman who came up to my room subsequently with a plate of chocolates and nuts and a bottle of wine in apology. I declined the wine as I don't drink but accepted the chocolates and nuts as he was insistent that I do so. In summary, I had a problem at the hotel but they managed to respond well to the incident and, lucky for all it happened on check-in rather than check-out when a delay with the carry-on might have had much more serious consequences. \nOn a side note, I discovered that one of the concierge was someone I knew from my stays at the Casablanca Hotel who previously impressed me with her thoughtful and efficient service, and bright smile and warm greeting each time. It is a credit to the Iroquois that such a wonderful employee moved over from the Casablanca given how fine a hotel the Casablanca is as well. \nAside from the incident, the hotel was fine. The room was large and comfortable, free wi-fi was included, location is excellent just off Times Square and with lots of subway stations near by and many restaurants within close walking distance. DB Bistro Moderne almost next door was surprisingly good and not stuffy notwithstanding its celebrity chef background, and the diner down the street from the Iroquois was excellent value, efficient and convenient for an early 6 am breakfast or a late bite. \nMy favourite in New York is usually the Casablanca for its unbeatable location, service and value-enhancing inclusions, but the Iroquois also compares well, especially because I managed to book at a fixed prepaid discount rate that was about $100 cheaper per night than comparable hotels at the same time.", "author": {"username": "VancTraveller", "num_cities": 8, "num_helpful_votes": 16, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 14, "id": "A6D6F39470197F3A398F92F2598D71F1", "location": "Vancouver"}, "date_stayed": "October 2011", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "October 31, 2011", "id": 119998282, "via_mobile": false}

I was initially apprehensive about leaving my son but the Babysitter's Guild has a good reputation and the hotel has been using them for many years. It is pricey at $25.00 per hour but it is worth it for peace of mind.\nWe didn't get to eat at Triomphe but based on other reviews, I will make sure we eat there when we go back. The Red Flame, a couple of doors down, was always packed. My husband picked up take-out breakfast from there one day and it was very good and reasonably priced. \nThe hotel is in a great location... shopping to the left, Times Square to the Right. We walked everywhere... to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, the United Nations, Fifth Avenue.\nSome people may consider the hotel pricey for its size but I take into account its location. Sure you can stay somewhere cheaper but it may be off the beaten track. The hotel is definitely small, but that's the way we like it.

It wasn't clear whether our room was ready when we asked (even though it was an hour after check-in time) but nonetheless, within a few minutes, we were on our way up the elevator. \nThe room that my girlfriend and I shared was costly compared to its size (almost $600 for a suite that barely fits a king sized bed, a small desk, and a dresser). However, the hotel itself as well as the room was very clean and classy. The bed linens were also particularly nice, and comfortable. The plasma HDTV was nice, especially for watching game 3 of the Red Sox vs Rockies world series. However, none of the HD channels worked, and neither did the HBO. \nFor the price we paid, I was going to take advantage of the free overnight shoe-shining they offered. You put your shoes in a bag outside your door by 12 AM, and by 6 AM your shoes are back and shiny. Apparently there was a malfunction since my shoes were never shined.\nWe asked about the HD channels and the shoe shining when we checked out, but we were answered with what basically amounted to an \"oops.\" The HD had stopped working, and the hotel was unable to get technicians in on the weekend to fix it. In other words, they were too cheap to pay the weekend rate, since in NYC I find it hard to believe that someone wasn't available to perform this service. Most of our time was spent outside of the hotel anyway, and TV is not generally one of my concerns. \nWe were happy to have our parking ticked validated for the garage across the street.

It was their friendly telephone manner that determined our selection of the hotel. As well, we were truly grateful for the bottle of wine and chocolates they gave us in celebration of our 25 year anniversary. We also believe that the amazing room we had was because of the staff wanting us to have a memorable occasion. \nThe sleeping room and bathroom were luxurious. However, the shorten queen size bed felt a bit odd as your feet and legs hang over the end. There is no readily available ice or ice bucket. As well, if you touch anything in the bar fridge, the item's price is automatically added to your bill. So if you are thinking of having a chilled glass of wine, you need to involve housekeeping or make sure that you tell the front desk to deduct any \"moved\" items from your bill. If you are wanting a cup of coffee in the morning to warm you feet that may have been exposed to the night air, you will need to call room service or go down to the front lobby since there are no coffee makers in the rooms.\nHaving no readily available ice or coffee is not a big deal. And as for a shorten bed the amazing pillows and sheets make up for any discomfort. What reduces our rating of this hotel is the lousy housekeeping. Dirty glasses were not removed and cleaning was minimal. As for complaining about this lack of service, we should have talked to the front desk since contacted housekeeping staff made no apology for their lack of effort. \nSo our recommendation for this hotel is excellent if you get a good rate. \nWe have two other more generic travel complaints. We can't stand bell boys. If we were able to carry our luggage half around the global, why do hotels think it is imperative to pay someone to take our luggage via elevator 100 feet? If we need help, we will ask for it. I would rather just give $5 dollars to a bell boy just to leave us alone. Our next beef is with US airways, who cancelled our flight 2.5 hours before departure without any compensation or assistance in finding alternative arrangements.

On the good side, the suites are very nice and spacious. The free DVD's to borrow are a nice touch. The location is great. The subway at Bryant Park is the closest and it's nice to walk through the park during the day. Know, however, we took cabs towards the end of our trip and thankfully the hotel is between two of the most famous hotels on the west side: the Algonquin and the Sofitel. Not one cabbie ever heard of The Iroquois, but when I mentioned either the Algonquin or the Sofitel, they knew exactly where to go.\nDue to a very shoddy concierge staff however, we won't be staying here again. Thinking it would save us time & trouble, two weeks before our trip I booked the house limo to take us to The Iroquois from our home and back. We were quoted a price, worked out the times and were even given the color of the limo and the driver's name. Two days before, I called to confirm the pick-up time and was told there was a problem with our booking. I was told that the other concierge girl had us quoted us the price for a town car & not a limo. They said the limo would be almost double the price each direction!!! They told us they could call out a different company for the price we were quoted, but that \"we might get a foreigner who speaks no English\" and they couldn't account for the way they'd drive!! They said they would \"absolutely not send their top-of-the-line limo out for that price\" and the only thing they would do was send the other company and \"it wasn't going to be a very nice limo either.\" I was shocked! They wouldn't budge. I called my regular limo company and luckily, after explaining the situation to them, they took us both ways for even less than The Iroquois quoted originally. I cancelled the limo service with The Iroquois and thought the matter was done. I was sorely mistaken.\nWhen we got to The Iroquois in our privately booked limo, there was a letter waiting for us at the front desk confirming that we were using the house limo to go home. This was the very same limo we had cancelled with concierge two days prior. The concierge representative that was there happened to be the same girl I actually cancelled with and she apologized for this SECOND error and said she\u2019d correct it. We got the \"corrected\" letter later that day, but unfortunately, concierge must not have read it themselves, since it was simply a copy of the one we received earlier. We contacted the front desk this time who said they\u2019d take care of it. We didn\u2019t see the concierge hardly at all the rest of our trip.\nWhen we checked out, our account was still wrong and concierge was again not at their post. We therefore had to speak with the manager and the front desk again before we could check out since our bill was all wrong due to this now beyond pathetic concierge error.\nThe hotel itself was very nice. However, if you need to book anything through the concierge, I would not recommend this hotel. The Iroquois\u2019 concierge does not honor its word and they don\u2019t value their customers at all.

What started as a disaster ended up being a pleasant weekend in NYC, largely due to the quality and service at this hotel.\nKnowing that I was going to pay $300+ for any decent room in midtown I wanted to try something new and perhaps better than the usual W, Hyatt, Waldorf and other hotels in the 300-400 range. Based on reviews here on Trip Advisor I decided to take a chance...I was not dissapointed. The reviews are quite accurate.\nExcellent for adults looking for a quiet yet conveniently located hotel. The rooms (I had two similar ones) are spacious by NYC standards with a chair+ottoman, full size dresser and smallish desk with chair. Well-laid out. Bathroom amenities (Molton Brown, my favorite) and fixtures (compact Ritz Carlton style) were superb. Plasma TV, windows that actually open, frette linens, comfortable bed (almost Ritz-like), mini-bar, etc. Only thing missing is a coffee maker; I hope someone from the Iroquois is reading this.\nStaff was quite accommodating to all of us stranded travelers. They kept the same rate through the weekend despite typically higher charges. They had the uncommon ability to know when to help and when to leave you alone. I especially like the hot cider at the front desk in the evening...it took the bite out of the ice storm. Loved the library off the lobby, perfect antidote for small NYC rooms.\nI spent the weekend watching the St. Patty's parade (started in front of the hotel) and shopping. It is convenient to the men's stores on Madison. Didn't get a show in but this is a perfect close yet quiet location. \nI will never stay at another NYC hotel again.

There was nothing special about the rooms. It was tiny. It only consisted of a bed, tv (although it was a nice flat screen, half the time the channels wouldn't change/hear them), and a bathroom. The beds were pretty comfy though. The desk/concierge wasn't too friendly. Every time we asked for help/info it always seemed like a hassel. I never felt comfortable. We got an ajoining room with an outer door. That way we could keep our doors open and close the outer door. Well... the outer door locks and there is no way to open it! We realized it and asked the maid to please ask the desk to open the door. We returned about 4 hours later to find a locked door. So we went down to ask the desk and they said they would send the engineer up to open it. Why don't they just have a key??? GOSH. Well we waited... and then waited some more for the engineer.

Last year my husband and I stayed there for 3 nights and enjoyed our stay so much that I booked a room there when traveling with a girlfriend to NYC for 4 nights. I was pleasantly surprised to see that one of the front desk staff and one of the doormen were still there - a sign of a good hotel when they can keep staff. My husband and I had been upgraded to an executive king for our stay and I have to say that our room, on the back of the hotel, was exceptionally quiet and comfortable. I was alittle worried when I was learned that the classic doubles, which I booked for a girlfriend and me, weren't located in the rear of the hotel and therefore might be noisier. I really had no cause to worry. This time we were on the top floor (12) and while we had little in the way of a view, the room was perfectly comfortable, exceptionally clean, and almost as quiet as the room my husband and I had. The beds are incredibly comfy - the soft linens, terrific pillows, and great mattress - made for some very comfortable sleep! The marble bathroom is a delight even if it is on the small size. The plasma tvs are quite large and of very good quality.\nThe hotel feels very European, which I prefer, over some of our oversized American hotel chains. While there is no coffee pot in the room, there is free coffee downstairs and continental breakfast (cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee, juice) delivered to your room is very reasonable (there was so much food the two of us could share one breakfast). We also enjoyed having a drink and some small plates in the hotel bar where the staff is friendly and unpretenious.\nThe location of this hotel is perfect. There are a number of hotels on 44th so cabs are readily available.

It\u2019s less than two blocks from Times Square, and it\u2019s in walking distance from most of the theatres and surrounding restaurants. A big plus, the Iroquois is located directly across from the Hippodrome parking garage. Have the hotel validate your parking ticket and you\u2019ll pay a discounted rate. For these reasons, we will definitely stay here again when we go to another show on Broadway.\nWe reserved a CLASSIC room through American Express Travel. We got a much better rate compared to the hotel and other travel website rates. The room was nicely decorated, clean, yet very small. There is a large HD Flat screen television on the wall and desk in the room. For a short stay, it\u2019s perfect. We were assigned to room 300, on the third floor. The view from the windows is towards a small alley/courtyard. Not pleasant to the eye, but it has its advantages. The room is not subject to most of the street noise. We were actually quite impressed how quiet it was. We heard a few horns hear and there, most likely from the cars that are exiting the parking garage. The hotel locked up our luggage after checkout, and held it for hours till we left the city. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful!\nThe only complaint I have with this room is its\u2019 location within the hotel. It\u2019s directly next to and across from two elevators. I also believe there is housekeeping quarters nearby. So we heard every person coming and going, as well as doors opening and closing. Since its low season, we did not find this as bothersome, but I can imagine it would be if the hotel was full. You can hear conversations right through the door loud and clear; as they can hear yours. For this reason, I could not give it the highest rating, but I would stay here again.

Unbelievable! Better than my own! The whitest, softest comforter and softest sheets - like sleeping on a cloud. And I think we had 6 pillows to choose from. The only negative about the room was a disappointing view of the fire escapes, but we got over it quickly. The other side of the hotel might have had a better view but probably more noise.

When we checked in very early in the morning we were laconically pointed towards the elevator, with no offer being made to assist us with our luggage.\n2.

In fact, I couldn't figure out where or how to turn on that sign, even if I had wanted to.\n3. Sometime during the afternoon of our second day the internet wireless went down and I was unable to conduct some business. When I brought this up with the front desk I was told that the internet was up and there was no problem at all. (Translation--I was somehow doing something wrong). It turned out that the internet was indeed down for the rest of the evening and was not up and running until the next morning.\n4. The servicing of our room was consistently late (past 2 in the afternoon). One afternoon we returned to the room past 3 p.m. and it had still not been cleaned. Of course, I informed, once again, the front desk. Needless to say, they were not pleased with me. I noticed that with each of my \"complaints\" they became less and less cordial.\n5.

Since the reviews were good I decided it was worth a try. The service at the front desk, the restaurant, and the bell desk was excellent. I was upgraded on check-in and the room was quite comfortable. There was a flat panel TV, a very comfortable bed, a complimentary 1/2 bottle of wine, bottle of Perrier, and a small box of chocolates. There were terry robes in this room and the towels were nice and fluffy. I had some problems with the wireless internet, but was told they have signal boosters available. The room was a typically small NY hotel room, but it did have a desk. There was also a small fitness room at this hotel. I have already recommended it to friends and I plan to stay there on my next trip to New York.", "author": {"username": "RoColorado", "num_cities": 25, "num_helpful_votes": 50, "num_reviews": 32, "num_type_reviews": 20, "id": "25DA37700C0FA3B51298DD2C67DAB686", "location": "Fort Collins, Colorado"}, "date_stayed": "August 2006", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "August 31, 2006", "id": 5730868, "via_mobile": false}

Shortly after a staff member arrived at the door with a Batman bubble-bath for my little boy - a really nice touch. The room is crammed with equipment - games console, CD, DVD, plasma TV, minibar but being so small it is a bit tight on space.

If you don't have too many bags be sure to take a right into the parking garage just before the hotel entrance and then check-in to the hotel.

Windows can be opened if desired.\nThe bed is wonderful, as everyone says, and the bathroom is very nice, excellent shower. Plasma TV and nice furnishings. Everything is spotless, of course.

Her first trip to NYC and I wanted it to be special, since it would be a memory of a lifetime for her. First task: Pick a hotel.\nFirst, we saw the Iroquois featured on a TV travel show and I made a note of it. Second, I used the TripAdvisor Reviews extensively to check out independent reports of the several hotels I was considering. One criteria was for a small, luxury type hotel ( 4-star minimum) that would not overwhelm my daughter but provide comfort, class, service, relative safety and great location. In this regard the Iroqouis met my expectations.\nI expected smaller rooms per the reviews I read and was not surprised. Even with a double bed room, the room was \"small\" by some standards. Same goes for the bath; but it was marble and spotlessly clean with very high quality towels and robes.\nThe beds were fantastic. The bed linens and comforter were first quality. We slept well.\nA note about room location: Many first timers to NYC want rooms overlooking the city. From experience I knew that an \"inside\" room is generally preferrable for noise considerations. I also booked the room from the hotel's website and took advantage of an off-rate program for the time of year I was visiting. So, room location was what I expected. We got room 1108. Yes, another Review writer (who had room 1107 )commented on a noisy \"compressor\" (actually a fan) audible from the room. I heard it also, but my take on such things is different: As long as something like that is not overwhelming and is classified as \"white noise\" I find it can be a benefit for sleeping.\nThe TV is a top notch flat screen plasma unit. High definition channels come alive. BUT, there were some stations listed on the channel card that were not available. And that list was somewhat limited to begin with. This actually was not a big deal, because we were not hanging around the room anyway and late night arrivals meant we promptly went to bed.\nThe closet space was very limited but ingeniuosly fitted into the room. A room safe was provided.\nWe noted the snack and drink bar unit but I instructed my daughter not to touch it due to the high prices that normally accompany them.\nThe free bottle of Perrier was nice.\nStaff was great and helpful. Even the desk clerk hailed a cab for me when the bell staff was otherwise engaged. Concierge very nice and helpful.\nWe only ate one breakfast in the hotel. It was good and not that high priced by NYC hotel standards. I wish we could have tried the Triomphe Restaurant for lunch or dinner but time did not permit. My impression from their menue is that they try to keep the meal prices within a somewhat affordable range at least as hotels go. (For budget friendly eats, go a few steps west in the same block to the Red Flame.)\nThe best thing about the Iroquois,aside from the great way they treated my little girl, is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!

Co-workers, fed up with the snobby Sofitel, had been staying at the Iroquois and gave it rave reviews. I am typically a Marriott points junky, so I have been staying at the Courtyard on 41st for business, but am frankly fed up with the crowds, waits for elevators, no restaurant/bar, and weak service that Marriott provides. For this trip in early January, no convenient Marriotts were available, so I decided to look into the Iroquois. I did my research on the web. They had a very user friendly site, and I reserved a suite or two rooms that adjoined since we were traveling with a 7 year old and a 9 year old. I immediately got an email response confirming our reservation with all the detail required. We walked from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden (since we took the train into the city from Trenton) and got to see a little of Times Square on our way to the hotel. We arrived very early in the morning so I did not expect our rooms to be ready, and they weren't. A very professional and apologetic staff member told us exactly when to come back and introduced us to the concierge and the bellman to store our bags. The concierge was extremely helpful and provided maps and directions. I had done a lot of planning in advance so had already made some reservation. We took the concierge's advice on 5th Avenue, the SONY museum (free) and a carriage ride through central park. We also took her advice the next day on the Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium which were both great. They had fresh coffee in the morning in the lobby. The rooms were very nice. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean. There is a mini bar (careful, has motion detectors, need to watch small kids)and the hotel leaves a small box of chocolates and small bottle of red wine to welcome you - a nice touch. The rooms were nice sized for NY and the bathrooms looked like they were recently redone and had marble tile. For two nice rooms at less than $500 total for both rooms per night, it was definitely worth it. The best part was that it was a small hotel, so no waiting hours for an elevator, the staff was very friendly, and you could walk anywhere - Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Central Park - yet it was quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends who are looking for a nice boutique hotel.

Yes, the non-suite guestrooms are cozy by out-of-towner standards [averaging 250-275 square feet], but this is Manhattan. You can pay much more for even less space, comfort, and service elsewhere, e.g., the W hotels. Indeed, one can often book a suite at the Iroquois -- with a not-at-all-cramped living room doored off from the graciously-sized bedroom & a bath which includes both a soaking tub and separate, walk-in shower -- for less than a standard room at many better known hotels. Plus, all the rooms at the Iroquois have marble baths [combined tub/shower in non-suite rooms] and are well sound-proofed; I have never heard noise from the rooms around me or the hallways. If you are a very light sleeper, however, you don't want a room which faces onto 44th Street.\nThe Iroquois was first suggested to me several years by the folks at Express Reservations (a great booking service by the way) as being especially appropriate for a businesswoman traveling alone. They were right; I've always felt secure & well cared for there, even at the bar where a solo woman will feel quite comfortable & enjoy having an after-theatre nightcap.

Die Zimmer wirken auch dunkel, was wir aber als sehr angenehm empfanden. W\u00e4hrend unseres Aufenthalts war es br\u00fcllend hei\u00df in N.Y. und die gut funktionierende Klimaanlage war in den sch\u00f6nen Zimmern eine Wohltat. Wir hatten eine Suite gemietet, die aus einem ger\u00e4umigen Wohnbereich mit ausziehbarer Couch f\u00fcr zwei Personen bestand und einen Schlafraum mit Bad (separate Dusche, Badewanne mit Whirlpool, Toilette, 1 Waschbecken). Die Einrichtung war gediegen, aber geschmackvoll. Ich k\u00f6nnte sie mir auch in einem englischen Landhaus gehobenen Standarts vorstellen. Die Couch war leider zu kurz f\u00fcr unseren vollj\u00e4hrigen Sohn. Ich habe nicht nachgemessen, doch l\u00e4nger als 1,80 m wird sie wohl nicht gewesen sein. Wir haben deshalb noch ein Zimmer, zu dem von unserem Wohnzimmer aus eine Verbindungst\u00fcr bestand, dazugemietet. So hatten wir wirklich gen\u00fcgend Platz. Wer nur das nachtr\u00e4glich gemietete Zimmer zur Verf\u00fcgung hat, findet einen kleinen, aber gem\u00fctlichen Raum vor. Entsprechend New Yorker Verh\u00e4ltnissen sehr \u00fcbersichtlich, aber mit allem Erdenklichen ausgestattet (Flachbild-TV, DVD-Player, Dockingstation f\u00fcr MP-3-Player etc.). Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit, an der Rezeption befanden sich auch zwei deutschsprechende Mitarbeiter (Muttersprachler). Auch der \u00fcbrige Service lie\u00df nichts zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig, die Zimmer wurden zwei Mal t\u00e4glich aufgesucht und gut gereinigt. Abends fand man auf dem Kopfkissen die Wettervorhersage f\u00fcr den kommenden Tag und eine kleine Schokolade. Die Zimmer verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber eine Minibar (mit Sensortechnik!). Wir orderten dann aber einen K\u00fchlschrank, der ausdr\u00fccklich angeboten wurde und am n\u00e4chsten Tag auch aufgestellt wurde. Da zuvor keiner verf\u00fcgbar war, sagte man an der Rezeption, man k\u00f6nne ruhig die Minibar ausr\u00e4umen und eigene Getr\u00e4nke hineinstellen, das sei nicht problematisch. So machten wir es auch, bis wir den K\u00fchlschrank bekamen und es war in der Tat unproblematisch. Zu erw\u00e4hnen sei noch, dass W-Lan auf den Zimmern zur Verf\u00fcgung stand (kostenlos) und schnell und gut funktionierte.\nDas Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck nahmen wir im zum Hotel geh\u00f6renden Restaurant \"Triomphe\" ein.

De kamer was wat klein, maar zag er goed uit, evenals de badkamer, hoewel het gebruik van de douche nogal onduidelijk was door de vreemde kraan, die men erg hard uit de muur moest trekken. De kamer werd goed schoongehouden en 's avonds lag er meestal (!) een chocolaatje op ons kussen. Al met al een goed adres, behalve dan de enorme geluidsoverlast van (waarschijnlijk) het ventilatiesysteem, dat de hele nacht doorronkte als een goederentrein. Een ander systeem, misschien was het de lift, deed het meubilair schudden als het geactiveerd werd. Gelukkig had ik oordoppen bij me, anders had ik geen oog dicht gedaan!
