Very friendly and helpful. I'll thank them for their excellent service. \nThe complimentary breakfast was not great. The pastries were bland in keeping with a theme that included only two cereals - Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies. Yogurt, apples, juice, milk, coffee, toast, and bagels were also offered.\nI can recommend this hotel - it is clean, the rooms are large, and the location is good.

Check in was a breeze, no need to wait in a long line or anything like that. The room was excellent for the price, compared to the normal, puny-sized rooms of New York. There were 2 separate rooms, one with a king bed and one with a sofa bed. The sofa bed was a queen bed, so it was big enough to fit two people, but for our convenience, they brought in an extra roll-in bed for us. One of the best things about this hotel was that its room service almost immediately brought you whatever you wanted. For example, I asked for more towels and shampoo before I showered, and they delivered them in less than two minutes. The breakfast was rather simple, but the quality was still good. Sometimes it got so crowded that you had to wait in a line to get in. The breakwast was also light, hence the name \"continental breakfast,\" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel's location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming. The concierge performed magic tricks for my 5 year old son and gave him chocolates, which brightened up his trip a bit.

Outstanding experience!\u201d", "text": "We just returned from our one night mini-vacay from NYC, and I can't wait to write about our experience staying at the San Carlos Hotel. My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. \nFirst of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a \"home\" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn't care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. \nThe amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don't worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! \nFinally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. \nOn Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn't want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations.

We had a 12th floor executive suite facing 50th avenue, from 13 to 19 September.\nHotel location is OK, many restaurants at walking distance, 2 blocks away from subway station, lots of groceries stores nearby, friendly reception staff. Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.\nThe suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. \nBed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them \"double-glazed\"), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.\nBreakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.\nThe San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.", "author": {"username": "Gabriel C", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 21, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "9B330AB13A6C8D282E82CD1BEC042156", "location": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 22, 2012", "id": 140920753, "via_mobile": false}

It had been a few years since our last stay and apparently it had become more popular since then because of all the good reviews. I guess it is a hidden gem no more! My grown daughters say that they will stay no where else when they are in New York City. Once again, the San Carlos did not disappoint.\nWhen we arrived, Gabriel (I think-no name tags) at the desk immediately greeted us with humor. Since it was my husband with me and our two daughters, he referred to my husband as \"Charlie\" the entire time and we were the \"angels\". We had booked a standard two queen bed room but Gabriel said that we were in a king room suite with a small kitchen at the same rate. I asked about the bed situation and he said that if my daughters were unhappy with the sofabed that we could switch. He assured them that the matresses were new and comfortable. \nOur suite was very spacious and we loved the kitchen area. We seemed to be facing out to a street but it was very quiet in our room. Besides the kitchen space, we had a little table and chairs area, two closets, a desk, two comfortable cushy chairs and a big screen TV plus the king bed! So nice for NYC. And my daughters never had a single complaint about the sofabed. I always especially like the real plants in the room and the roman shades. It seems to give such a homey touch. The bathroom was also spacious with robes, toiletries, plenty of towels and a makeup mirror, etc. We couldn't think of anything they didn't provide. \nEveryone as usual was very pleasant and friendly, always greeting us when we came and went. My husband was especially pleased with how quick the bellman got our luggage up to our room-even before we left the front desk. He had to track him down to give him his tip. We saw the umbrellas lined up as usual on a rainy day but we had our own. Everyone always provided help with our questions when asked. My husband enjoys the fact that he can set up transportation to and from the airport through the San Carlos before our trip. I love the scale in the lobby to weigh your suitcases before your flight-which they do for you if you want! I travel a lot and don't see a scale very often in a hotel lobby. A nice touch since I always want to know what mine weigh before I get to the airport.\nWe love the San Carlos for its amenities and spaciousness but also for its location to 5th Ave. (a few blocks walk straight up) and the subway lines (right on the corner). We also found a great Mexican restaurant on the next block behind the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is a little lacking in variety but that doesn't bother us because we are getting FREE breakfast in NYC!!\nWhen we left, Gabriel joked with us once more and gave us free pens to take. We noticed a small boy coming in after us and he immediately started to show him a magic trick. We had to laugh!

The room is huge and has a mini kitchenette too. Super clean and comfortable. Parking is self park right next door with a discounted rate of $30 per night-even with our SUV! The gym is small but did the trick and there is a Starbucks less then a 5 minute walk away! The free continental breakfast is simple but did the trick. \nThe staff was very friendly and helpful. We had brunch at Madison Restaurant after we arrived-a huge diner that was delicious and the wait staff very nice. We got cupcakes at Buttercup Bakery on the way back to the hotel. We saw Cirque du Soleil our first night and ordered a pizza and salad from Albitino's which is a 5 minute walk. Our last night there we ate at Chop A Steakhouse (a 10 minute walk) and took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu. A fabulous experience.\nDuring check out the manager did a magic trick for my daughter! I have stayed at the Affinia chain and much prefer this hotel for traveling with teens/tweens.

It was quite clean and had good space, a nice sized closet, including a nook with a fridge for my own groceries as well as a mini bar. The bed was comfortable. A clock radio that will charge your iphone with plenty of plugs to recharge your electronics. I liked my room quite a bit. The front desk staff was kind and very helpful. They allowed me to check in early, and store my luggage on the day of departure. The doormen did a wonderful job helping with taxis and offering advice. However, they can not overcome everything.\nI had 2 significant problems during my stay. One was the noise in the hotel. Two was the lack of any civilized dining, as well as no room service at all.\nThe doors in the hotel slam. So between rowdy guests coming and going at all hours and the morning housekeeping staff hollering down the halls, sleeping at 10 pm or 8 am was just not possible. The walls are thin and I could hear the televisions of neighboring rooms. Believe me, I am accustomed to NYC noise and not much gets to me. The noise at the San Carlos was just overwhelming, not just annoying. I was there 5 nights, and guests cam and went, but the noise level did not change. Such a disappointment.\nHowever, the thing I hated more was the breakfast service in a cramped dark hot room. Breakfast, which was limited to bad bagels, toast, a couple of varieties of cereal and coffee was a chaotic mess. Tiny paper plates, cheap plastic knives that break, and tiny coffee cups that are too hot to carry was a horrible way to begin my day. Everything was disposable and unpleasant. Honestly, the airlines do better. I stayed there five days and not one morning could I easily grab a cup of coffee and take a seat. Just a mess. Don't even think about requesting a coffee service to be delivered to your room either. Other midtown hotels have self serve breakfast, and it works. The key is space, good variety, and enough staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and to provide assistance. Actual glassware, plates, and utensils would be nice. This just is the worst.\nThe San Carlos has the potential to be a good hotel. I wish I wanted to return. I wanted to like it very much.

With so many choices, it should be easy to find a myriad of properties that suit any number of requirements. But for me, it was a struggle to find the perfect location, level of amenities, and acceptable price point for a recent 4-day trip w/ my hubby.\u00a0\nI ruled out the overpriced hipster boutiques, the stuffy landmarks, the dinosaur properties, the tourist-laden chains, and the too-good-to-be true rates in less desirable parts of town. After that, I wasn't left with nearly as many options as you'd think.\nThen I found the listing for the San Carlos. I loved that they're one of the very last independently owned hotels in NYC, catered to a European clientele (which usually means non-fussy rooms, immaculately clean spaces, and competent staff), and the Manhattan East location; the area was convenient to RCMH where we were seeing 2 nights of concerts. The fact the rooms looked large vs the price and came w/ mini fridges and microwaves (somewhat unusual for Manhattan) sealed the deal. But looking good on paper doesn't mean in reality it will pan out.\nI'd made my reservation months in advance, over the phone, for a certain room type that the young lady I spoke to had 100% guaranteed. When I called week-of to confirm my reservation, I was told there was a possibility I might not be able to get the room type I'd been promised. Irked, I referenced the original reservation but they explained sometimes these things happen. True, but I hung up the phone and considered rebooking elsewhere; the phone rang back moments later and the young lady I originally spoke to apologized, said they would upgrade me at no fee and get me what I needed no matter what, and really acted as if she valued my business. I'd expect this from a 5 star property, but at a under $300 a night spot, it was refreshing. Customer service is a dying art. The staff at the San Carlos is old school, in the best possible, most refreshing way.\u00a0\nUpon arrival, an easy cab ride from Penn Station, the lobby was sparkling, the bellman exceptional, and the check-in flawless. It's not the fanciest place, more suited for the upscale business traveler (though I spied many families too) but the cleanliness, a huge factor for me, absolutely perfect. And my room, a King, was HUGE. Not huge just by NYC standards, huge by any hotel standard.\u00a0\nThe view from our particular room wasn't much to see, but windows that actually open in both the room and bathroom were a bonus. The amenities were lovely, towels and robe divinely soft, the bed linens super comfy, and a pant press a blast from the past. The room was modern, simple, understated, private, quiet, and cozy. Everything worked too. Which should go without saying but unfortunately is often not the case in any class of hotel. The real silverware, plates, and glasses provided were a great compliment to the microwave and fridge.\n\u00a0Did I mention that housekeeping is outstanding? In my years of travel, I've never seen more competent housecleaning.\u00a0\nMy interaction with the staff was easy peasy. Items I needed were sent up immediately, dinner spots/phone numbers provided, and I was always greeted with a smile. I dreaded check out because it meant our experience was over. I literally had zero complaints during my entire stay except that the Indian restaurant next door (that serves as the San Carlos' complimentary breakfast serving area and then offers their own menu for limited room service too), is simply not up to par with the rest of the hotel. \u00a0If 24 hour American cuisine room service is a make it or break it deal for you, that's about the only reason I'd consider finding a different hotel. Seeing as Manhattan has every food conceivable, most of it deliverable, I easily overlook this.\nQuiet rooms, pleasant interiors/halls, a great business center/overflow lobby, elevators that were kept constantly cleaned (check the Ritz for smudges, lol), and staff that valued my business means that next I'm in NYC I'm making a beeline right back here. Sure, there's more glamorous or hip spots, but for the level of service vs price and comfort, there's a reason this is a hidden gem amongst your hundreds of NYC hotels.

Blocks in NYC are short so most things are within walking distance if you're a walker, and you can always find a subway near by if you're not. \nThe night staff was wonderful in making restaurant recommendations. The gentlemen made suggestions and each one was better than the next. Chin Chin was probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I've eaten at. The staff was welcoming, courteous and helpful.

While we waited, the front desk staff entertained our kids with magic tricks!

The bell staff (Bobby, Johan and Matthew) were friendly and knowledgable, and gave us good suggestions for families since we were tourists traveling with a 10- & 11-year-old. During our stay there were thunderstorms and the hotel had \"loaner\" umbrellas near the door for our use as we cruised around the city, which was great.\nI've read complaints from others about the conteniental breakfast, but we thought it was plenty of food and choices. Since it was included in the room price for the four of us, it was a terrific value (you can't beat free). The breakfast consisted of rolls, assorted pastries, bagels, (the little chocolate croissants were especially yummy), tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, orange juice, assorted yogurts, cottage cheese, whole apples, assorted jams, cream cheese, Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes. The nice lady working at the breakfast kept everything well stocked throughout the morning (7-10 a.m.)\nOur suite was clean and well appointed and roomy (we couln't believe we had that much space in mid-town Manhattan). The housekeeping staff was wonderful too. They were available the minute we requested anything. Returning from our daily adventures, the place was always spotless and my dirty dishes were the all done. What a luxury! The kitchenette came with a microwave, refridgerator, sink, dishes/service for 4 +. \nThe Hotel location is also wonderful. It's walking distance to many attractions and a variety of restaurants (although there is a subway station not too far away). The front door staff is on top of it when you need a cab hailed (although much of the time we just tried to walk off the great Italian food we'd eaten in the neighborhood).\nThe staff of the hotel went well above our expectations.

I am beyond particular and Gabriel was attentive to the requests that I had made when making the reservation. He actually let me look at a couple of rooms to make sure that my preferences were met. The room that I chose was not yet available (it was very early) so I shopped for a while. When I returned to the hotel, Gabriel said that the owner of the hotel wanted to meet me. I travel at least 80 days a year and have for several years--I've never met the hotel owner. The owner was charming and lovely and was clearly interested in making sure I had a good stay. My room was lovely--a beautiful upgrade. The experience at the San Carlos was very much like staying at a friend's beautiful apartment. Everything was clean and fresh. The bed and linens were a good quality. The location of the San Carlos is excellent with subway and bus lines within steps. I prefer midtown east--so this location is really perfect.

There are fresh and delicious rolls, bread, croissants, danishes, muffins, orange juice, delicious coffee, hot chocolate, yogurts, cottage cheese, apples, etc. etc. When it was raining out, the bell boy offered us umbrellas to take with us. The doorman was great at hailing taxis for us, running into the gutter and blowing his whistle. The hotel's location is fabulous. There are tons of restaurants and coffee shops close by. The subway is only a block away. The hotel is walking distance from Rockefeller Center, Central Park, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord and Taylor's, the Apple Store, FAO Schwartz, etc. etc. etc. There is also great nightlife in the vicinity.

It is away from the crowds, but is within easy walking , subway or taxi distance from everything. Parking is right next door with discounts for hotel patrons. It was $30 for 24 hours, but we have an SUV so we had to pay an extra $10 for an over-sized vehicle. Still less than parking in Time Square. On our last day, the doorman had us park in front of the hotel after checking out so that we wouldn't have to pay extra in the parking garage. The staff was fantastic and had great suggestions for restaurants, transportation, and sight-seeing. We stayed in an executive suite which I would suggest if you have grown children. There was a king bed and a large sitting area with a pull out sofa-bed. The sitting area had two other chairs so there was plenty of room for all of us. We brought an inflatable twin mattress so our two kids had their own sleeping space and even with the sofa-bed out and mattress inflated, there was room to walk around. We entered the room to see a brand new 42\" flat screen still in the box in the living room. They installed it while were hit the town! The suite had a kitchenette area with a breakfast bar and two chairs which was nice. It was separated from the sleeping area a little bit so any early risers could have coffee without tiptoeing around the sleepers. There was also a small refrigerator and microwave. The kitchen was stocked with utensils and plates, and no dishwasher since housekeeping would do the dished every day :) The bathroom was adequate, but not overly large and we had two good-sized closets. This was a very roomy space for NYC! Only downfall for some travelers might be the nightclub across the street. There was a line outside starting at about 11:30 to midnight and we could barely hear them talking, but we really couldn't hear the music inside. We were on the 6th floor so if you go higher, you might not hear anything. We did hear some people singing happy birthday outside the club at around 2 a.m., but we just went back to sleep.

We bought tubs of cereal at the convenience store across the road and took them in to eat. Also took our real tea cups down to breakfast. We also had a couple of hot breakfasts across the road at the \"new york lucheonette\"-good. The japanese restuarant across the rd is great, ate there a couple of nights, and there is a fantastic indian around the corner near the steak place. You can walk to broadway easily from there - we made a five minute dash to catch a show. The subway is on the next corner and once you get to know yourway around is fantastic way to travel. Never wait longer than 3 minutes for a train. The hotel was our oasis to return to after a hard day of pounding the pavement to regroup have a drink then either relax or get out there again.

I believe they have plans to upgrade it.\nFor many a tourist, the location really can' t be beat. The Waldorf is just out the back door, and it's worth the money to splurge for tea or a cocktail there. St. Patrick's and Rockefeller Center are an easy walk, and on a nice day there is nothing nicer than to take a cab or the subway up to the Metropolitan Museum, and walk back through the Park or down Madison Avenue.

Everything is spotless, very well maintained and it obvious they must replace immediately anything that gets worn out.\nIt is a good feeling to stay there...\nWE had a one bedroom suite, consisting of a bedroom with a king bed, a large bathroom, a living room with a sofa bed, a second smaller bathroom and a small kitchenette area with a micro, a sink and dishes and cutlery and a small fridge.There is also a mini bar and a table with two chairs. There was an iron board and iron and a pant presser. Two flat big TVS. Actually everything that we needed was there. They also have FREE wi fi, and also a free breakfast that it is simple, yet comes very handy. IT consisted of coffee, good juice, tea, chocolate, all kind of breads and Danish , cream cheese, butter marmalade and organic yogurts.Breakfast is self service and in paper cups but nevertheless it was done with some flare.\nLocation is very good in 50 between Lexington and Third, the 49-50 crosstown bus makes it very convenient , also a block away is the 6 Subway convenient to go to places like Soho, and one more block the E line good for Greenwich Villages and the Meatpacking district.\nMay be the best thing was that all the people that work there are very pleasant and helpful. Sheets were changed , either every day or every other day, I am not sure, but they were of very good quality and impeccable.\nWE got a very good rate taking advantage of a 20% discount if pre paying.\nNever in New York I got all this in one hotel.

We knew we could get as far as New York, so on our last night in Mexico we went onto tripadvisor and found the San Carlos in NYC (we had stayed in NYC on our outward journey and knew the area we wanted to be in). After reading the positive reviews we went to the website and got a room for 2 nights that could accommodate the four of us. Yes it was pricey, but all good midtown New York hotels are pricey when you're booking them the night before arriving.\nCheck in took about 30 seconds, and the room was great. Had a fridge (separate to the mini-bar) and a microwave, and bowls/plates/cutlery. Very practical. The hotel has no room service but links to a number of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel and allow you to eat in the room (and charge it to your room as well). Much better quality room than the midtown Omni Berkshire where we had stayed for 4 nights on our outward journey en route to Mexico.\nComplimentary buffet breakfast was included at the San Carlos, which was a real bonus for New York. The breakfast seems to be the main source of complaint on the tripadvisor reviews. Get over it, it's free, what do you expect? And, we thought it was fine. Toast, good quality orange juice, fruit, yoghurt, tea/coffee - our kids were happy, and we saved ourselves a fortune over our extended stay. I'm sure that the Walfdorf Astoria around the corner would quite happily welcome the moaners in for breakfast at $30-$50 per head! \nWe originally booked for 2 nights, but European airspace remained closed and we had to extend our stay. The hotel was extremely accommodating and at short notice let us extend the room. We were then told by British Airways that we could not get a flight back for another 8 nights (!!!). Unfortunately the San Carlos said that they did not have that same room available for that length of time, but gave us a 15% discount on a suite, which meant we got a room that was twice as big, extra TV, sofa, armchairs, dining area, kitchen sink, fridge , microwave etc for about $25 per night more, for our extended stay. It was a fantastic room (actually 2 rooms and a bathroom) for midtown new york - much like an aparthotel. In fact it was similar to rooms at the Affinia 50 aparthotel, right across the street, but cheaper....and available, which the Affinia wasn't.\nThe hotel had a business/internet lounge with 6 fast PCs and printers, all free of charge. These were frequented most of the time by me and the other stranded European guests looking for flights home! The internet access was great as it enabled us to see that flights were becoming available, which we then phoned up and booked. It meant that we didn't need the full eight nights and our total length of stay was 5 nights. The desk staff were very accommodating and said \"no problem\" and still gave us the 15% discount.\nAlso should mention are eating options. No restaurant directly in the hotel, but in the lobby there is an adjoining door to the Mint Indian restaurant next door. Fantastic food, and most notable was that it was full of Indian guests, always a good indicator. We ate there on 3 of our 5 nights. Our 2 children 13 and 9 ate everything presented at them - no burgers , nuggets or fries in sight. \nHotel had a great location - 1 block from 51st/Lex Subway and 3 blocks from 53rd/Lex Subway which gives you a choice of 3 subway lines. For cheaper options for food (to take back to the room) turn right out of the hotel and then go north one/two blocks on either 3rd or 2nd avenues. Plenty of delis and supermarkets, which you don't tend to see on Lexington, Park or Madison aves (the other direction).\nSo in summary, a great hotel - we would definitely stay there again if we go back to New York. Staff very welcoming and helpful, particularly Bobby on the door/concierge duty. I've stayed in New York 4 times, twice for business, twice for pleasure. By far the best hotel, and not the most expensive.", "author": {"username": "AfricanWanderer", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 7, "num_reviews": 5, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "07F8D03F7285B0A9F5060C486C3EE6C9", "location": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom"}, "date_stayed": "March 2010", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "April 30, 2010", "id": 62899980, "via_mobile": false}

We overlooked this assuming our room would be fine, but it too also smelled badly of stale smoke. I thought rooms in NYC were non-smoking, but apparently I was wrong given the air purifier functioning in our room, as well as an ashtray in the top drawer of the nightsand.

My spouse and I relocated to what was promised to be a \"comparable room\" on the 6th floor. Unfortunately we got downgraded from a King to a Queen, and also had a handicapped room with a disgusting tile bathroom floor with visible dirt in the cracks. To make matters worse, I opened the toilet and found someone else's waste there - unflushed! I flushed once, and quickly realized the issue, it was clogged. Immediately water started running over the top and on to the floor - so we called the front desk.

San Carlos is not bad but there is nothing really special for the price you are paying. Yes, there is a complimentary continental breakfast included but it is in a windowless corner room and with a very limited offering that can be beaten by any basic 2 star airport hotel. Maybe the worst disappointment was for the service. It wasn't overly friendly and you had to ask for everything rather than the service being offered. It was also disappointing that during the first day the receptionist was selling us a helicopter tour and his only reason was \"You should really do it because we get a commission for it. You should help us make our living\". I hate it when the service people see customers being there just to make their living rather than them being there making the customer happy.

We had a very nice sitting room area with comfy sofa bed for our daughter. Two bathrooms and nice kitchen area which was handy for coffee and snacks.\nStaff were very pleasant and helpful. Continental breakfast was fine with good choice of breads, buns, yogurts, lovely juice and tea/coffee. However I think it would easy to supply small packets of cereal or at least yogurt with cereal on top.\nThe price seemed pretty good for New York but it is annoying to be hit with $60 tax per night when checking out.\nOverall the location of this hotel is great and our suite was very comfortable and relaxing to come back to after a busy day out and about. Our room was at the front and there was some street noise which only bothered us once or twice early in the morning.\nWe would return to this hotel but request a room at the back next time.\nOne tip about shopping: Friends told us about a great mall in New Jersey called Garden State Plaza. We took a bus from port authority bus terminal. It took 40 minutes and was well worth it. It has most of the stores that are in New York including Macys and it is much easier to walk around than the busy NY streets.

The Rockerfeller Center is 3 blocks away, Central Park and Times Square are just a bit further.

It was clean, nicely decorated and roomy for NYC. The kids slept on the sofa bed in the living area. The kitchenette was helpful for snacks (we had jet lag, having traveled from Asia) and the continental breakfast downstairs was perfect for our light breakfast eaters. \nThe only downside of our stay was having to be moved to another room on our last night because our bath was leaking into the room below (we had no idea). The staff was very apologetic and did their best to make the move easy for us. The new room on the 10th floor had a lower ceiling and was a bit darker than our previous room. \nThe attached Indian restaurant \"Mint\" is very good. Try the mint paneer which our whole family loved. The green lighting is a bit odd but the food is good. Across the street is a good family diner, across the corner is the Waldorf Astoria and their restaurants, etc.\nThe hotel staff was very helpful and friendly.

Booked this without seeing the mainly excellent reviews, based on a friend's recommendation, who I was going to NY with. My friend had stayed here loads of times so I kind of went along with it to avoid having to think where else to stay. I have seen this hotel described by some as a boutique hotel. Still not 100% certain what that really means, as I have also seen the Hudson described as boutique but in terms of design they are chalk and cheese with Hudson as hip, cutting edge and San Carlos very traditional new york.\nStayed for 3 nights in September '07. Found nothing wrong with this hotel but at the end of my stay, I asked myself if I would stay here again. My answer was really no. Having now read all the excellent reviews on this hotel I cannot disagree with anything that has been written and my reasons for not wanting to return may not be valid to all people. \nI felt that the hotel was more of a business orientated hotel. You could walk in to the lobby, go up the lift to your room without seeing another guest. Those occasions you did see a guest - was usually corporate businessmen. Some people like the fact that its quiet but i felt it lacked atmosphere and character.\nWe had a 1 bed suite which was not cheap. $600 a night. But even the standard rooms are $400 a night. The decor was ok. Inoffensive but not luxurious by any means and was certainly not hip or cutting edge. The size of the room was good with a leage seating lounge separate to the bedroom. Air con was a bit noisy but you got used to it. Bathroom was very small and could have done with updating.\nThe location is good, central to Lexington and 5th. The lobby staff were good and helpful.\nTherefore in summary there was nothing I didn't like about this hotel. but there was nothing really i loved about it either....and for the price (which is not so much in the Top price range, but seems to be the Deluxe price range) i think i expected something a bit more.\nNot for me then, but would suit others. If you want a hotel with a buzz, good atmosphere, somewhere to hang out in the lobby and do a bit of people watching, I would look elsewhere. But if you're happy with a quiet sanctuary from the bustle of NYC, with a good location, using the hotel purely as a base it may well suit.", "author": {"username": "NWLondontraveller", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 133, "num_reviews": 10, "num_type_reviews": 10, "id": "867B47D4E0E98273164EA3C2973A9BBD", "location": "London"}, "date_stayed": "September 2007", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "January 24, 2008", "id": 12952415, "via_mobile": false}

The Lexington Ave subway is around the corner, Rockefeller Center and Fifth Ave shopping is three blocks west, and the Times Square area is several blocks west. If you wish to avoid the craziness but still feel close to Times Square and the theater district, this hotel is an excellent choice. \nOn the second floor overlooking the lobby, the San Carlos provides three computers 24/7. There is also a printer which is helpful for \u201ce-ticket\u201d boarding passes. If you simply can\u2019t leave the lap-top at home, there is wireless access throughout the hotel. \nBreakfast at San Carlos consists of a variety of breads (including raisin bread), rolls and bagels for toasting, as well as pastries, yogurt and cottage cheese. The dark chocolate pastry roll was particularly good! There was a fruit basket with the usual suspects, too. Beverages included coffee, tea, orange juice and a pitcher of water. \nOverall, I would say the San Carlos is a good choice for location and accommodation.

On arrival we were greeted by a very nice porter who helped us with our bags. Check in was swift and the staff were very friendly. We were originally given a room on the 10th floor. It was the smallest hotel room I've ever been in. We were really unimpressed having read other reviews and viewing pictures online. I went back to reception and explained that we booked the hotel because the rooms looked spacious and comfortable but our bed was hard and our room was tiny! The receptionist apologised and told us he would move us the following day, he couldn't have been nicer about it. \nThe following day we were moved to a room on the 15th floor, it was at least three times the size of the original room and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on! We were delighted. Lots of TV stations to choose from after a hard day shopping and great shower and bathroom!\nThe location of the hotel is perfect. We walked most places as the main shopping areas are within walking distance. It was my second time in NY and my boyfriends first but he couldn't get over how well laid out the streets are. \nThe breakfast is quite good in the hotel. We had toast and yoghurts most mornings although one morning we decided to treat ourselves and went across the road to the diner and had sausages and eggs. Quite reasonable and the food is very tasty. It's across the road to the left, beside Kimberly Suites.\nWe didn't try the room service. I would also recommend the steak house across on 3rd Avenue, Smith & Wollensky - best steaks we've ever had. Quite pricey but the food is amazing!\nThe staff in the hotel were exceptional! One of the doormen in particular. I didn't catch his name but he comes out and opens the cab door for you when it pulls up, offered us an umbrella when it was raining, he was just a really nice guy. \nWe had no problems in this hotel (apart from the box room which was sorted almost immediately). I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's conveniently located, extremely comfortable and the staff are excellent!

All the staff we met are a credit to the Hotel, and are always very pleasant and helpful. My sister and I stayed in a spacious and very comfortable one bedroom suite on the 5th floor, with 2 double beds, 2 tvs, bathroom and separate living area with fridge, microwave, coffee machine, etc. We had a street view, and yes it can be noisy but it is New York...you don't go there for the peace and quiet! You get used to the noise very quickly and it didn't stop me from sleeping well. There was only two of us staying in this suite but it would probably suit up to 4 adults, as there is a pull out sofa bed in the living area also. The hotel also has a fitness room and lounge on the second floor with internet access available, if you have the time or inclination during your stay. They serve a great free continental breakfast each morning in a room off the lobby with things like oj, coffee, yoghurt, toast, pastries, which get topped up regularly. If you prefer a hot breakfast, recommend you try the deli across the road, which is open 24hrs. It was always full in the morning, and a lot of locals seem to use it. They also do take out as well. The hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant, but \"Mint\" is well worth a visit. A top class Indian restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere. The room service at the hotel is delivered from \"Mint\" and is well worth a try if you don't feel like going out. Also try \"Lilys\" on Lexington Ave for a lovely Sunday brunch. The hotel itself is in a great location, with a subway stop round the corner in 51st Street, you can get around Manhattan quite easily. Buy a Metro card , even if you are only there for a few days, it's well worth the money. The hotel is within comfortable walking distance to most sights, approx 15 minutes to Times square and Central Park, less than 10 to Rockerfeller. Although if your want to give your feet a rest, then try one of the many city bus tours about. For the second year we got a Grayline 48hr hop on hop off ticket, which covers uptown, downtown, Brooklyn and night tours for $49. It's a great deal, and although their main pick up point is at Times Square, the uptown tour stops outside the Waldorf on 49th Street, so you can join it there. Recommend the night tour, which will take you over to Brooklyn, worth it to see the Manhattan skyline alone. You can purchase tours like this and other attractions from the hotel reception, but it may come in the form of a voucher/coupon which you will need to exchange at the tour starting point/attraction for a ticket. Shopping wise, Woodbury Common is worth a visit, with a number of designer outlet stores, selling clothes, shoes, luggage, etc. There are regular buses to Woodbury Common from the Port Authority bus station. If shopping in Manhattan, remember to get your discount card at Macy's to get 11% of most goods there, although be warned you do pay tax on goods bought in Manhattan. \nTo get back to the hotel itself, you won't go wrong if you book to stay here. I have recommended this hotel to many people since my first visit. The location of the hotel, standard of service and accomodation is excellent, and we felt really at home here, it was a wrench to leave.

I can't say enough good things about this hotel. We are avid travelers and have stayed in many, many hotels. I always thoroughly research a hotel from the travel books I read but I base my decision on the public's opinion of the hotel (from reading the reviews). I always find that the people who stayed there are the most honest about the accommodations. My husband was hesitant to trust my judgement because he likes to be safe with name chain hotels, but now he can't say enough about how great a choice I made. We choose a hotel for the space, amenities and location. We had a very spacious room for NYC standards with two double beds, two nice windows with controllable roman shades, a comfortable sitting chair and ottoman with a table, a desk area with chair, an armoire with a flat TV and real plants in our room! The furniture was not jammed against each other either- there was lots of space to walk around. We loved the refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker in the room which is one of the main reasons why we chose it. The rooms are decorated in a modern, clean homey atmosphere with bathrobes too. It was extremely quiet in our room (we requested a quiet area of the hotel) with no street noise and we didn't even know there was a family next to us until we saw them leaving their room. We didn't have a view of anything but a building but I'll go to the beach for that. We weren't in the room most of the time anyway. The location was perfect, central to Fifth Ave, Rockefeller Center and the subway, etc. We actually were going to stay at the Waldorf Astoria (which was right on our corner) for $20 more a night but we read the reviews that said the rooms were small and not worth the price. So true! The service was wonderful. When we checked in, we were told about the gym, breakfast times and given coupons during our stay for shopping. Any question I asked of the staff was answered pleasantly. I got directions and a map for the subway and was shown a store around the corner I could go to for snacks and groceries. The doorman went to the corner for us to locate a taxi and set up a car service for us to get to the airport. It was ready and waiting for us when we left! My daughter (18) was most impressed that when she got in the elevator alone, a male employee stepped out and let her ride up by herself. She was also offered an umbrella when we left one night when it was raining and when she tried to return it was told to keep it. Umbrellas were lined up at the door for guests! What service! I did read the reviews about the breakfast just being yogurt, fruit and pastries, but my husband skips breakfast and my teenagers are happy with just a muffin so it worked for us. The assortment of pastries was very diverse and it was free so who's complaining. The only negative thing I could say about the San Carlos was the beds could be queen instead of double because my husband is rather tall and we weren't used to a double bed.

A big hello to Virginia a voluntary member of an organisation called the Big Apple Greeters. New Yorkers who give up a few hours of their time to take you around a neighbourhood in New York, we would never have seen as much of Greenwich Village as we did so once again thanks for that. The hop on, hop off buses are good but can take a good hour/hour and half to do the loop so if you want to see a couple of attractions far apart this can be a little time consuming. Ice skating at the Wolfman ice rink and the buggy ride in central park are a must. For Shoppaholics Woodbury Common in New Jersey is a must you can go on a grayline coach for about $40.

It is in a good area and we felt quite safe walking about. An added bonus was the delicious buffet style continental breakfast. The staff were extremely polite and helpful - booking taxis, advising on restaurants, giving directions- even provided brollies for the sudden downpour of rain! Nothing was too much bother. There was four of us (2 adults, 2 teenagers 19&16) sharing a one bedroom suite. There was plenty of room - 2 toilets, 2 televisions(not that we saw much telly because we were so busy out and about) 1 king size bed and 1 double sofa bed in the living room. There was even a small kitchen area fully equipped with microwave, coffee maker, fridge, cutlery. This allowed us to bring in our own drinks and snacks so we didn't use the mini-bar. Our request for extra towels/toiletries/help with pulling out the sofa bed was promptly dealt with by the housekeeping staff. We were on the 9th floor and at the front of the hotel. There was a lot of street noise but thats New York for you! We had no trouble sleeping! Would highly recommend the sightseeing hop on/off tour with the \"Blue Buses\" City Sights. Ticket agents on most street corners with bright yellow jackets! We paid 49 dollars each for a 48 hour pass but this gave us an Uptown tour, downtown tour, Brooklyn Tour (don't miss that one - the guide is a legend!!) free cruise to see Statue of Liberty (75 mins)tickets to the museum. All the tour guides were great and informative (leave a tip if you want to!) Saved on shoe leather and aching feet too!! One tip though - you can be on the bus a while especially due to the volume of traffic so a visit to the restroom before boarding is advisable!!

The bathroom was also large and much better than we could have expected.\nThe location of the hotel is great. A minute of Lexington Avenue, 20 minutes walk to Times Square and about 15 minutes to Central Park. It is also right next to a subway stop which gives easy access to the rest of New York. The area around the hotel was safe and we felt quite happy walking back there quite late at night.\nThe staff at the hotel were fantastic. From the doormen to the front desk they were all incredibly helpful in giving tips of what to see and what would be the best way to get to certain sights. They went out of the way to help, including ringing our airline for us to confirm the time we would need to check in for our flight out of New York.\nTe breakfast at the hotel was fine. Plenty of bagels, croissants, Danish Pastries etc. One suggestion would be go earlier at about 7:30. At this time we fund there was plenty of room to sit down and plenty of food to choose from.

AND - it's free!\nOnly two gripes about the San Carlos; one was the seemingly random restocking of the amenities (3 days without mouthwash!), and because they're only a small hotel I couldn't claim any reward points for the stay (which would have amounted to at least a free night with Marriott Rewards etc)..

(Fortunately there was a luncheonette across the street.) \n Ask for a room on the back side and away from the housekeeping closet.

One of my biggest \"must haves\" in a hotel is that it be very clean with updated decor and furnishings. This hotel had both. I was very impressed. We took advantaged of an \"off season\" promotion...stay two nights get the third free, I think we paid $260 a night?? This deal scored us a one bedroom suite with a king sized bed. It was plenty big for my husband and I and I would actually say it was be large enough for a family of four or for a girls trip of 4. We actually didn't really even take advantage of all the space. There is a full bath and a half bath which made getting ready great. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was a nice perk. Location was good. A subway station was close by and it seemed the walk to Central Park / 5th Avenue Shopping and Times Square were pretty much equal in time..give or take. The elevators were super fast for a smaller hotel. Maid service and turn down service was great. My only complaints would be the bed was very firm (which some people like), however the linens were very comfortable. Also, the street noise was distracting (mainly the horns coming from the nearby intersection), but we were on the front side of the hotel on the 10th floor. The rooms on the back may have been less noisy. \nOn my last visit to NYC, a year earlier, on a girls trip we stayed at the Doubletree Suites located in Times Square. While I would recommend that hotel as well, I wanted to stay out of the Times Square crowd this visit. I enjoyed the location of the San Carlos Hotel, I felt a little less like a tourist.

Also juice, coffee and milk. Last time I checked this IS a continental breakfast. And they are consisent and clean which as a frequent business traveler, this is what is most important. \nRooms - The rooms are aged, as it is a boutique hotel in an old building, but I have yet to ever get a dirty room and the decor is very modern. Oh, and they tuck every night with chocolates every seems not to be mentioned, which is definately not something you will get at the Marriott, or some of the nearby hotels. Also, it they are generous with their toiletries (Aveda hair products, mouthwash, ear cleaner, hair cap, cotton balls, etc.) which is in line with a 4 star hotel. Also, bathrooms & linens are always clean with decent decor. Last, most rooms are pretty roomy and about 50% or more now have flat screen LCD TVs or an flat screen TV. There is a mini bar and all the basics like most decent hotels (coffee maker, blow dryer, robes, etc.). \nSecurity - They have security cameras EVERYWHERE, not because it is a bad place, but to make sure their guests feel and are always safe. I think this is super important. \nGym - Although MOST hotels do not have gyms like the Leows hotel in Philly like a gym club, they do have a roomy gym with decent cardio equipment and water, towels and a bathroom. \nNoise - This is true, noise cannot be avoided, heck you are in between Lexington and 3rd, I choose this hotel for location and unfortunately, there will be lots of traffic & noise here. For me it is ok, b/c when I want to get out for a coffee or snack at 1 in the morning, there are always people around, so for me, safety overrules noise, but I admit it does not work for all. \nService - I have yet to have any bad service, or any of the numerous collegues that I have recommended to stay there. Most of the time, they are super friendly and the door men, boy they can get you a taxi or give directions anytime. \nComputers - they have 3 computers and a printer on the 2nd floor for use for free. They also have free high speed broadband in all rooms. And the couple times I have a project crunch, the front guys have helped me by holding or sending off packages and faxing for me, which I do not abuse this, but it is nice to have in an emergency. \nLocation - OK, within minutes you can be anywhere worth visiting in NYC. And for the business traveler, there is fed ex kinkos 3 blocks down on 3rd and also another on Lexington and 2 blocks up on Lexington a Staples. Also, there are several subways near by, like 1-2 short NY blocks away that can get you virtually anywhere in NYC. Shopping & restaurants galor, need I say more!!!\nI agree, there are much nicer hotels, at a heftier price, like the Waldorf, but for $300'ish a night this is a great deal and not less for any of the comparable hotels like the Benjamin or Affinia 50 (trust me, been there, they are pretty much the same!).

We say NO. This hotel is quite less than what it and others says about it.\nFirst, the property is neither elegant nor charming and defnitely not sophisticated. The reality is that the property is nothing more than a bit above a Holiday Inn Express or similar hotels that you may find on any airport strip,\nSecond, while the Hotel trumpets its offering of a free continental breakfast one would be well advised to brace themselves before viewing the selection and confines of the offering. A closed and spartan room with tables and chairs accompanied by an orange juice dispenser and toaster does not, a continental breakfast make. \nThird, previous commentary on Trip Advisor laud the staff for their friendliness and desire to accommodate. That was not our experience. On our arrival, we were confronted with ATTITUDE and plenty of it from the front desk representative who in a pre-emptory fashion dictated that one of the two rooms that we had booked was to be changed. No discussion or advance advisement. We challenged the representative and only when asking to speak to the Manager, were we able to arrive at a compromise.\nThe room(s) were not elegant nor sophisticated but rather what would you expect from a hotel that is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The interior of our rooms on the 10th floor ( Junior Suite and Exec King) were well worn with the bathroom showing distinct signs of use and needing a good painting,\nFinally, previous writers on Trip Advisor have referenced the street noise. We agree and there was plenty of it. For a hotel that has spent a significant amount of money on refurbishment ( their words) and notwithstanding that New York is and can be a noisy city, the noise from the street at all hours is quite incredible.\nFor our money ( and the hotel is not cheap) we say that the San Carlos is not what it seems nor says and to that extent, we say exercise caution in choosing the San Carlos Hotel.

We previously had reservations at the Avalon hotel, but the reviews of the Avalon started getting worse, so I took advantage of Tripadvisor's review and found the San Carlos. \nThe San Carlos is PERFECT. We traveled with our two grandchildren (age 10 and 7 years) and they loved the hotel too. We took advantage of the business center on the 2nd floor to \"play\" on the internet during the evenings and the kids used the workout room a lot (always with our supervision). We enjoyed having the continental breakfast available...it was nice to have a quick bite to eat before we journeyed out in the morning. \nGabriel at the front desk taught our grandson magic tricks (that was a hit!) and Matthew on the door was wonderful. Housekeeping staff are friendly and do a fabulous job. We also saw quite a bit of the hotel owner, whom we found to be charming. The kids were really impressed that the HOTEL OWNER knew them! You don't get that kind of attention in the chain hotels.\nWe adored the rooms (we had a one bedroom suite), and appreciated having two televisions. The refrigerator and microwave both came in handy as we were able to bring leftovers home from restaurants and enjoy them later. The hotel is very quiet, and in a great neighborhood. We are from Seattle and we felt a lot safer walking around NYC after dark than we do in our city. It's also extremely close to a subway entrance.\nWe were lucky enough to have Arlene Dunn as our Big Apple greeter (this is a great thing to schedule... you'll learn so much and it's free!). She felt like family to us. \nWe took the all day Royal tour of New York and it was wonderful. Steve, the owner, was very informative and made us feel like he was an old friend who was showing us around his home town. His tour costs a little more than the others, but I think it is well worth it. He doesn't book a lot of people on each tour so you don't spend half your time waiting for someone to show up so you can go on to the next stop. \nWe did most of the things that tourists do in NYC, and thought that the Top of the Rock was a better view than the Empire State building. \nHighlights:\nTony and Tina's wedding (an interactive play). We all loved this! \nThe Statue of Liberty\nTrinity Church, where the rescuers went on and after 9-11 (be prepared to cry).\nSt. Patrick's Cathedral\nA New York Yankee game\nBronx Zoo\nConey Island (everyone needs to go there once)\nCanal Street in Chinatown...you get to barter there, and believe me, it's very addicting.\nA cruise around all of Manhattan with Circle Line tours (we had a very informative and dapper narrator).

The climate controls in both the bedroom and LR & the variety of lighting throughout -- little \"downlights\" over framed artwork in both the living room and bedroom (we had a 1-bedroom suite), wall sconces, table lamps, overhead lighting and a good desk lamp -- are notable. And the contemporary furnishings are tasteful, comfortable and more upscale than those we found in our rooms at the Affinia or the Kimberly. \nIn addition to the well-stocked \"honor bar\" (with less outrageous prices for its contents than at many Manhattan hotels), there is an under-the-counter refrigerator, a microwave, and small sink in the kitchenette/wet bar area whose cupboards and drawers hold glassware, dishware & flatware. The two closets and a number of deep drawers gave us more than enough storage space for our clothes & luggage. There are no drawers or cupboards in the bathroom, but the counter is wide and runs the length of the room, so we found it perfectly acceptable & the Aveda toiletries are a nice touch. Lastly, everything was scrupulously clean & well-maintained; we never heard any noise from fellow guests in the hallways or the rooms around/above us; and our sleep was not disrupted by street noise as is often the case in Manhattan.\nThe free breakfast isn't the spread you'll find at the Embassy Suites, but it doesn't pretend to be more than a continental breakfast: the pastries were skippable, the coffee & OJ were above average. And since there are a number of eateries just outside the door and most hotels don't offer anything to their guests, I'm not going to knock the SC on this score. We did experience a few intermittent problems with the in-room internet access, but they were short-lived, and with the computer center on the 2nd floor, you'll never be \"stranded\".\nWhere the San Carlos falls a bit short is on its front-end service. With the exception of Gabriel (who I think is the manager and seemed topnotch), the desk clerks and doormen were quite young... very pleasant, but not super polished, could use a bit more training & level of information about what's in the neighborhood. Check-in/check-out, however, was efficient and there were no errors in our billing.\nIn short, given its location, the quality of accommodations and the amenities, the San Carlos is an exceptional value. I recommend it highly!", "author": {"username": "Portia", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 50, "num_reviews": 6, "num_type_reviews": 6, "id": "AD78D6F550B22FE1BFEE04C4F1E6A68C", "location": "New York"}, "date_stayed": "April 2006", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 21, "date": "April 19, 2006", "id": 4988711, "via_mobile": false}

In my humble opinion, for the price the San Carlos charges, a better, more confortable and luxurious accomodation can be obtained from any of these three suite hotels.

The rooms are larger than typical NYC, are decorated nicely and very comfortable with wonderful reading chair and ottoman, along with desk and two double beds. Ample closet space. Bathroom was a little on the small side with little room to store toiletries, makeup, etc, but very nicely done. There is an internet room on the mezzanine at no charge, which was wonderful for checking email, etc. Had four computers with very little waiting. Also very nicely done small fitness room. Staff was very courteous and helpful, suggesting alternate transportation on the subway when cabs were not in abundance during the snow storm. No bar or restaurant directly in hotel, but an Indian Restaurant is attached and provides room service. We didn't try it, so can't comment. However, there is a great little luncheonette across the street which we used for breakfast and lunch once each. Also ate at the steak place directly across the street - it was fabulous. Wish we had tried it sooner. The breakfast buffet provided by hotel was adequate - coffee, juices, pastries, bagels and toast only. Nothing to write home about, but a nice touch for the days you don't want to eat heavy early in the day. There was a small refrigerator, a microwave, plates, silverware and coffee bar in each room, along with an honor bar, which was much appreciated. Hotel definitely has more charm than typical large chain hotels. Very welcoming and homey.

There was always someone waiting outside the hotel to open the door for you when you came back to the hotel and the staff always said hello; nothing seemed to much trouble.\nI guess it was lacking in facilities compared to some of the giant firms, there is no pool or hotel bar/restaurant, but in New York you only have to step outside the hotel to find whatever you are looking for so we were not bothered at all by this. The gym was small but I thought it was brilliant, each station is equipt with a tv so you can watch while you work out. The cyber lounge is a brilliant idea and was really useful; there is even a printer if you need to print anything off.\nThe rooms have such comfortable beds and are kept immaculately clean everyday by the wonderful housekeeping staff; the Aveda bath products are a great addition.

The location is great, and you can walk to 5th Ave shopping, Central Park, Broadway. etc. Breakfast which is included was simple and enough to get you started each day. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others.", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "March 21, 2004", "id": 1734936, "via_mobile": false}
{"ratings": {"overall": 5.0}, "title": "\u201cWonderful Weekend at a Wonderful Hotel\u201d", "text": "This is a long, but informative review. My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our Valentine's day weekend thanks to the San Carlos Hotel. I booked an executive suite weekend special through the hotel's website about 2-3 weeks in advance and was excited to have a beautifully appointed and newly renovated room. On Friday, we parked the car next to the hotel, checked in and got upgraded to a one bedroom suite, then quickly made our way to the 14th floor (out of 18.) When we walked in we were amazed--closet and bar area to your left and bathroom (with a full length mirror on the door) to your right and straight ahead was the living room with new couches, chairs, endtables, a glass table (magazines included) and a 2 person eating area (with a lovely bamboo plant for decoration!) There was also an entertainment center which had the flat screen tv and N64 control (just in case) and next to that was the desk with complimentary high speed internet access (a huge plus--my boyfriend brought his laptop.) The door to the bedroom was just past the bar area on the left. The bed was a queen size, but we weren't complaining since there was the mini-bar in the room (which was adequately stocked--best bottled water ever, and the liquor/beer selection was great too) as well as another flat screen tv, alarm/cd player, a corby press pants, chair and closet. The bathroom didn't have a huge bathtub, but it was definitely up to par (be sure to make use of their bathrobes and aveda products.) Also to be noted was the separate air/heat controls between the bedroom and the living room. The suite was beautifully decorated with paintings and pictures and the bedding/furniture was modern yet had a homey feel to it. We thought \"if only there was a kitchen\" that we'd ask how much the rent was, we wanted to move in! Once we settled in, we made use of their delivery menus. Since there is no restaurant in the hotel yet, they supply you with 5 or 6 different types of restaurants that deliver--from Japanese to Italian. Ordering the food was a piece of cake and the bill gets added to your hotel account. The service at the hotel was excellent--they promptly brought up our food along with a bucket of ice, which we asked for. There was also alot of good on-demand movies to choose from, so we watched one later that evening. Saturday morning we woke up on our own (no maids knocking--they take the Do Not Disturb sign very literally) and ordered breakfast, although there is also a comlimentary continental breakfast between 7-10. When we had to leave the suite the doorman was ready to hail a cab for us. We were always greeted when we came back to the hotel. Check-out was also a breeze and was asked if we enjoyed our stay and if we were taken care of, which we were. All in all, we had a fantastic time at the San Carlos. We've stayed at many other hotels in the city, but this newly renovated gem on the east side is ranked #1 on our list so far, so we'll definitely come back in the future.", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "February 18, 2004", "id": 1659264, "via_mobile": false}

We discovered a classic Japanese suhshi place across the street - Nada Sushi - that in almost 30 years never made into Zagats but is beloved by the local cognoscenti.\nWe can never stay away from New York for long, and we are looking forward to a repeat performance with our new friends at the San Carlos.", "author": {"username": "", "id": "", "location": ""}, "date_stayed": "January 2005", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "February 6, 2004", "id": 1637096, "via_mobile": false}

The hotel staff was wonderful and welcoming to us (me, my husband, and two kids, ages 7 and 11). We had a one bedroom suite, which included two small but comfortable rooms, one containing a sofa bed, table and chairs, and kitchette area (sink, microwave, fridge), and the bedroom containing a nice bed and lovely bathroom. We also had two tvs, which is great when you are traveling with children. The free continental breakfast in the morning consisted of a variety of breads to toast, muffins, pasteries, yogurt, bagels, coffee, and juice--nothing fancy, but enough to fill us up and get us going without wasting time and dropping another $40 on breakfast each day. Our only complaint was that the noise from the street kept us up the first night, even on the 11th floor. By the second night, we were so tired, we didn't even hear it. On the way out, the concierge arranged a car service for us to the airport and the car was ready and waiting when we were ready to go. All in all, we had a great time and loved the hotel.

Unfortunately, service is dreadful, housekeeping sloppy, security lax, and management indifferent to guest concerns. On our day of arrival, we discovered a number of items of clothing - most of a personal nature - under the bed, and immediately contacted the front desk so they could remove them. Four days later, they were still in the same place. New bars of soap were not provided until the old ones were worn to mere splinters, and if two sheets of paper remained on the bathroom roll, a new one wasn't left. The kitchen utensils and glassware were dirty, light bulbs were missing from a couple of the lamps, and everything was covered with a fine layer of an unidentified greasy substance. On our last night, we returned to find our room ransacked and items missing, and the front desk clerk refused to call the police, leaving it to us to handle the matter. When advised of the situation the following morning, the hotel owner arrogantly accused us of having filed a false report in an effort to collect insurance, and literally chased us from his office out to the lobby, where in front of other guests he continued to make his absurd accusations!

{"ratings": {"overall": 4.0}, "title": "\u201cPreis/Leistung f\u00fcr New York wohl in Ordnung\u201d", "text": "Ein passendes Hotel in New York zu finden ist gar nicht so einfach. \u00dcbernachtungen sind teuer und trotz \u00fcppiger Preise bekommt man anscheinend h\u00e4ufig nur Absteigen geboten. Aufgrund der sehr positiven Bewertungen hier haben wir uns f\u00fcr unseren New York Aufenthalt dann f\u00fcr das San Carlos entschieden. \nDie Lage des Hotels ist super. 5 Minuten entfernt von Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall und UN. U-Bahn quasi um die Ecke.\nCheck-In und Check-Out gingen schnell und freundlich \u00fcber die B\u00fchne. Mit zus\u00e4tzlichen Informationen, Pl\u00e4nen, Tipps o.\u00e4. wurden wir jedoch nicht ausgestattet. Es liegen auch keine Brosch\u00fcren im Hotel herum. Das uns zugewiesene Zimmer im siebten Stock war deutlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer, als ich dies f\u00fcr New York erwartet h\u00e4tte, wirkte jetzt aber nicht super modern auf uns. Die letzte Renovierung liegt schon ein paar Jahre zur\u00fcck. Die Ausstattung hingegen ist o.k. mit Kaffeemaschine, F\u00f6hn, B\u00fcgeleisen und einem Schreibtisch. Wochentags liegt morgens eine USA Today vor der T\u00fcr. Leider haben wir ein Zimmer ohne wirklichen Ausblick bekommen. Die Klimaanlage des Nachbargeb\u00e4udes war sichtbar und vor allem h\u00f6rbar, und gab 24 Stunden ohne Unterlass einen Brummton von sich, an dem wir uns jedoch nicht zu sehr gest\u00f6rt haben. Immerhin war es im Hotel selbst recht ruhig, d.h. keine St\u00f6rungen aus Nachbarzimmern wahrnehmbar. Die Fenster lassen sich \u00f6ffnen, um echte Luft hereinzulassen. WLAN ist im ganzen Hotel kostenfrei vorhanden. Das Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck hingegen ist ein schlechter Witz und dem Hotelstatus eindeutig nicht angemessen. Der Fr\u00fchst\u00fccksraum ist eng und ungem\u00fctlich und bietet zu wenig Pl\u00e4tze f\u00fcr die vielen Zimmer. Die Auswahl beschr\u00e4nkt sich auf das allern\u00f6tigste und bietet nur unteren Standard. Sorry, in jedem 100 Dollar Hampton Inn oder Comfort Inn & Suites bekomme ich ein deutlich sch\u00f6neres Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck als hier. Auch Nachmittagskaffee oder Cookies, wie in vielen anderen Hotels der USA \u00fcblich, gab es hier nicht. \nAls nicht ausreichend habe ich auch die Zimmerreinigung empfunden. Man war st\u00e4ndig im Kontakt zum Zimmerm\u00e4dchen, das ab ca. 8 Uhr morgens ins Zimmer wollte. Wir haben dann erlaubt, dass das Aufr\u00e4umen in der Zeit stattfindet, wo wir beim Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck waren. Das ist dann auch in Windeseile und - trotz Trinkgeld - ohne sonderliche Sorgfalt geschehen. W\u00e4hrend drei Tagen Aufenthalt wurde nicht ein einziges Mal staubgesaugt. Sorry, da erwarte ich f\u00fcr den Preis einfach mehr, zumal ich es als unangenehm empfinde, zum Verlassen meines Zimmers \u201egen\u00f6tigt\u201c zu werden.\nIch vergebe mit R\u00fccksicht auf die Hotelsituation in New York dennoch 4 Sterne und w\u00fcrde hier auch wieder wohnen, kann mich aber \u00fcber viele enthusiastische Reviews hier auf Tripadvisor nur wundern. Da ist von \u201eLuxus\u201c, \u201eBoutiquehotel\u201c oder \u201etollem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck\u201c die Rede. Das alles bekommt man hier sicherlich nicht, sondern eine solide \u00dcbernachtung mit M\u00e4ngeln hier und da. Zu meiner guten Bewertung tr\u00e4gt auch die Lage bei und ein grunds\u00e4tzliches Wohlf\u00fchlgef\u00fchl. Wir f\u00fchlten und sicher und gut aufgehoben hier. F\u00fcr ca. 300 Euro pro Nacht ist dies wohl f\u00fcr New York ein ganz gutes Preis/Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis. Dennoch fragt man sich schon, ob man einen angemessenen Gegenwert erhalten hat. In jeder anderen Gegend an der Ostk\u00fcste abseits von New York oder Boston h\u00e4tte ich maximal 1/3 des Zimmerpreises f\u00fcr diesen Standard bezahlt.", "author": {"username": "joeycoco", "num_cities": 54, "num_helpful_votes": 89, "num_reviews": 92, "num_type_reviews": 59, "id": "F9CA74E8C898F9F2B8A8B30096A8D713", "location": "Hamburg"}, "date_stayed": "October 2011", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "date": "October 14, 2011", "id": 119295755, "via_mobile": false}

We usually stay at Berkshire Place or The Benjamin, in a suite, but neither hotel was available, so based on recommendations from hotel.com (which Delta connected us to), and the high ranking on Tripadvisor, we chose The San Carlos Hotel. It is in the same block as The Benjamin and The Waldorf Towers, a couple of blocks down 50th from Saks, and a straight route to Rockefeller Center, if you need to get your bearings. Hotels.com had a good rate, but the San Carlos website had an even better non-refundable rate.\nWe arrived at 9.30 am, checked our bags and were shown to the breakfast room for a complimentary breakfast. Our room was great...a king executive suite on the 9th floor. It was one very large room, with a kitchen (true coffeepot, microwave, refrigerator, etc) and dining alcove and a sofa bed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very large and quiet. We never once waited in line at the desk or for our bags and when we requested something for our room, it arrived instantaneously. One plus or minus is that there was no hassle waiting on assistance getting our bags to our room..we had carry-ons and took them ourselves. The hotel is pretty casual in that way, but leaves out no necessities and handles everything expeditiously.\nThe business center never had a wait for the computers, and thre is no charge for printing or use of the computers.\nBreakfast was a little hectic, but it was nice to have yogurt, toast, pastries, juice, etc. without leaving the hotel.\nOne of my favorite restaurants, Mint, is next door and owned by the hotel. Mint is a fabulous Indian restaurant with great ambience. Also, on the food topic, just around the corner is Pax, where you can get perfect salads and other items for your room.\nWhen I checked out, the manager brought the owner out to meet me, and if I had not already planned to write a rave review, I would have after meeting him. He is extremely personable and wants to be sure that his guests intend to return.\nWe took the hotel car to the airport for about $10 more than a cab and it was perfect...quiet, clean, on time, and hassle free. \nI do not believe there is any room service, but there are enough good choices for dining out or for bringing gourmet foods back to your own kitchen. All in all, a hassle free, lovely experience.", "author": {"username": "lrslippers", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 23, "num_reviews": 10, "num_type_reviews": 9, "id": "4C618B6E918F97A10C59561854416A6D", "location": "columbia sc"}, "date_stayed": "October 2010", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "October 26, 2010", "id": 84923639, "via_mobile": false}
