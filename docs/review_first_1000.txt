THis is a newer hotel, but there is no service elevator. I was continually surprised after waiting for an elevator at how many stops we made for housekeeping to enter with carts, room service carts and trays, etc. How could Hyatt skip a service elevator on this new property? It really stinks at times.....its bad.\nLastly, i have traveled with world and certainly know NYC pricing. Breakfast at the Andaz ranks above almost anything i have ever paid. Apparently, i had a $190.00 breakfast for two the first morning, and $175.00 the second. Eggs for each, coffee, berries. Wow. Of course, i really don't know...as there is no bill. They just deliver it, and leave. Prices are listed in the in-suite menu, but no itemized billing is given. I am 'gifted' with a $75.00 credit for my breakfast as a Diamond member, and i assumed that had not been applied when my bill reflected a 'non itemized' charge for $110 plus for the first night, and slightly less for the second. I was wrong, it had been applied (no way for me to see this). WOW. It certainly isn't worth it.\nI know i sound like one of those guys who complains about pricing, but clearly doesn't know what things cost. Wrong. This one really surprised me, and i have traveled the world for more than 20 years staying in some of the finest hotels in the world.

Viand diner downstairs was OK for dinner -- not great but sufficient. Friendly front desk folks were really helpful -- have breakfast at Bagel Talk not too far away. Very convenient to American Museum of Natural History -- easy to catch a cab or subway.

Went with my adult daughter and we stayed in a corner room with two twin beds on the ninth floor. It's tough to find good hotels with two beds in a room in NYC so this was a bonus. The room was very quiet. I could not hear anyone from other rooms, the hallway or any street noise. The room has a sleek modern design and was spacious for NYC standards. I loved the bathroom. Being able to get a cold bottle of water at all times was great and snacks in the rooms was a nice touch.\nI also loved the overall vibe of the hotel; small, hip, clean, and friendly. Great artwork. Not warm and cozy though. The seating in the \"lobby\" is not particularly comfortable or inviting. The staff was young and not as experienced as one would find at a five-star hotel but this is not a five-star hotel. They did the best they could to help with restaurant reservations, shopping information and other general information. Easy walk from here to Grand Central Station to hop the subway and cabs easy to find. Loved being across from The New York Pubic Library and Bryant Park. Lovely pop-up stores and ice skating in Bryant Park for the holidays. Beats the craziness of Rockefeller Center in my book. \nThere are a few problems that I believe can be corrected easily. One is the lack of proper lighting in the room, the architect and designers clearly were not thinking of women when they designed the rooms. It is very dark and would be really difficult if you were trying to get ready for a special event. Also there is no drawer space and the closet is minuscule. Not sure how to correct that issue. The other problem is that the beds, at least the twins we slept in, were not very comfortable. Very firm which is fine if you like it that way.

For some reason it was just a better experience than the restaurant.\n* Do use the concierge for tickets, restaurant and visitor recommendations. Everything they suggested worked perfectly and they enhanced our stay hugely.\n* Don't be afraid to walk and when I say walk I mean stroll. Take your time, look around and you'll be surprised how easy it is to get to places on foot. Empire State Building is insanely close by, Madison Square Garden a short walk beyond that. Rockerfeller Center, Broadway and Times Square make an easy and fun circular route and you can stroll up 5th Avenue to Central Park and beyond quite easily.\n* Subways are a nightmare to find if you're used to the clear signposting in London or Paris but once you done it once or twice you'll get the hang of it. The Setai is no more than a block or two in any direction from the subway.\n* Taxis are a law unto themselves.

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: \"It is What it is.\" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.", "author": {"username": "9Adventuress", "num_cities": 9, "num_helpful_votes": 26, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 13, "id": "212787FEB4E7A223D38277943BCA6E55", "location": "Cockeysville, Maryland"}, "date_stayed": "December 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 7, 2012", "id": 146977843, "via_mobile": false}

They recognized us each time we walked in and out, which made things really great.

Ours had 2 queen beds and not much room for anything else. The one negative was that it was rather dimly lit even when we turned on every last light, but from what I understand this is a green hotel and they are saving on energy and wattage. However, we would have liked to have the room a bit brighter since there was also a lot of woodwork and dark closet doors which also made the room on the dark side even during the day. The beds were extremely comfortable with nice white fluffy duvet comforters and down pillows. There were a lot of outlets and close to the bed (and located on the nightstands) which were great for charging phones and computers.\nWe were on a high floor with nice views. The rooms with two beds don't face the empire state building, which was a bummer because we hoped to see it from the windows.

Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs.

When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. \nUnfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called \"the red flame\". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. \nAs I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot.

And the reality two non sparkling bottles of water. If I wanted to have some coke it was necessary to use room service. It was not overpriced but still very annoying. And the promise given has not been fulfilled.\nThe other negative aspect was that we were not provided with advantages as LHW members except for thenice personal letter from the manager. Usually we receive at least some fruits, uograde, free internet or something...\nThe last negative point was about pre arrival assistance and concierge. We sent some requirements before our arrival but got answer only very late as our email was categorized as spam and the concierge had not chcecked the spam folder. We also had some difficulties with our reservation when in the city and were not able to reach the concierge via phone. We succeeded only after 15 minutes and sixth call. \nOne great tip about the hotel: no checkout time limit. Pretty good!\nDespite small negative issues we very much enjoyed the stay and can honestly recommend the hotel to others.", "author": {"username": "CzechTourist", "num_cities": 23, "num_helpful_votes": 19, "num_reviews": 27, "num_type_reviews": 23, "id": "93204D751F8796489DB9807AE98C2979", "location": "Prague, the Czech Republic"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 4, 2012", "id": 146744546, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed an unfortunate four nights at this hotel, and suffered major itching, including a major let down from what we were advised BEFORE booking at The Chatwal! We phoned prior to booking to ensure that the hotel had bathtubs (as our personal preference, we only book with hotels which have bathtubs) - we were advised that EVERY room has a bathtub - excellent, so we booked. We arrived all the way from New Zealand (19 hours of flight-time) at approximately 11:00pm to arrive to a major disappointment. NO BATHTUB! We phoned the desk from our room and were advised \"sorry, there's nothing we can do as all rooms with a bathtub are taken\". We then advised that prior to booking we were advised that ALL ROOMS have a bathtub - \"no sorry, you were told wrong, and there's nothing I can do but you are welcome to leave\". Then my husband went downstairs and spoke to the \"duty manager\" who then finally relented and looked up to see who would be checking out the following morning so we could get a room with a bathtub. We were then promised a room with a bathtub by 12:00 midday, but by the next morning, the woman at the desk advised \"sorry, but they are now checking out at 4:00pm\", so we asked for a refund for the first day since the whole inconvenience had ruined a whole entire travel day (WE had been trying to sort out this mess OURSELVES all night long and the following morning by arranging a room with a bathtub) - their reply \"sorry, there's nothing I can do\" - she didn't even offer any complimentary gestures as a way of saying sorry for the inconvenience caused by this ridiculous hotel! We would have loved to have checked out and moved to another hotel, however, upon such short notice and only arranging three days in New York, time was very restricted. This hotel is PERFECT FOR BACKPACKERS WHO HAVE MONEY! The hotel is so small and running on a strictly cheap budget that there is no doorman in the morning upon check-out.

When getting out of the taxi, we had our bags taken care of right away and directed towards the check in counter. We had no problems at check in, and received a complimentary room upgrade which was a pleasant surprise.

Leather closet doors that looked like trunks, an excellent bar area, and a comfortable big bed. The bathroom is amazing. While there was no bathtub, the shower made up for it as it was very large, and the toilet was quite neat with all these japanese style options. The amenities provided were also excellent.\nWe also used the butler service to have our shoes shined, and clothes pressed before dinner.\nHad a chance to use the pool, and gym facilities, which were adequate, but they were working with the space they had.\nThe location was very close to Times Square, so that was convenient, but isolated so the noise and traffic would not affect your stay.\nOur four night stay was quite pleasant, however you get what you pay for, and the Chatwal is pricey.

We used our Starwood points for the room. Little pricey, but it's a nifty hotel. The lobby area is small, but with gorgeous Art Deco. Interior of The Lambs Club restaurant is also really lovely. It's right off Times Square, so location is good for most things.\nRooms at the Chatwal aren't super big, but this is NYC and this is a retro location, so I didn't expect massive space. What they lack in size, they make up for in appointments. The rooms are done up kind of like I'd imagine a 1920s cruise ship. Leather doors with leather handles, kind of like old time steamer trunks. Lots of cubbies and efficient use of space. Cool bar. Bathrooms are awesome. As others have mentioned, the toilets have an unreal number of functions--bidet, seat warmer, air dry. Too many functions, really, but fun when you're on vacation.\nOur room was facing the alley, so nothing great on the view. But the room was nice enough that it didn't matter. Wish the bed had been a bit more comfy and higher off the floor--all the beds seemed very, very low--but overall I was pretty happy with the space. Service was great as well. Free shoe shine and you have a butler who can handle things like pressing your suit or dress for dinner.\nDid have a bad situation, which highlights the excellence of the service. We'd been given a room with a connecting door. Unfortunately, next door were three single guys having a weekend in the city and the noise was unreal. Like they were standing right next to you talking in your ear while you were trying to sleep. So we got to participate when they got room service at 2 a.m. when they got up at 8:30 and then again when the maids came in to clean at 9. After the first night, we complained to the desk and they gave us a new room.\nWe went out for the day and when we came back, they'd packed all of our things and moved them for us. And they were thorough--they even found the charger my husband had left plugged into the wall. So have to give them credit for the assist.\nThat said, if you walk into your room and there's a connecting door and you're not with the people staying in the next room, immediately get a new one. You will hear everything.\nOverall I enjoyed it. Honestly, I was probably expecting a little more for the level, so I wouldn't say it exceeded my expectations, but it was very nice. My gold status didn't really get us much of anything, so can't say Starwood helped much, other than to use the points. It's not inexpensive. It was 30,000 points plus per night, and more than $700 if we'd paid out of pocket. Not out of sync for this level in NYC, but the St. Regis was on the same point level and I can't say I think it's better than that. \nBottom line--if you're looking for something retro and cool, it's great. If you need something more modern or a lot of space, probably not for you.", "author": {"username": "dagnyt", "num_cities": 10, "num_helpful_votes": 43, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "2460DAC350A498A3DB494E1FE485F32C", "location": "Tallahassee, Florida"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 20, 2012", "id": 145838274, "via_mobile": false}

We had just come from two weeks at The Greenwich Hotel in Tribeca which was fantastic.\nThe ONLY reason this did not get a poorer rating is that the building is in a convenient location, this was a reason we choose not to move. You are right opposite Central Park with the horse and carriages and in short walking distance to all the main Fifth Avenue shops. Other positives were; spacious bedroom, heaps of wardrobe space, free wifi, free sodas that were refilled every day, comfy bed, plenty of bathroom amenities, choice of newspaper, heaps of TV channels and a coffee machine. Godiva chocolates were placed on our pillow at night, which you do not see often nowadays. There were a lot of old world touches.\nRather than give you two weeks of examples of the poor service we received, I will list just a few, remembering we are paying $700+ per night, it was $635 and then you add all the taxes. Before I start with the negatives, the reason for my heading is that Sherry lacks a lot of services that a hotel has, for example, there is no lounge to go sit in, read and watch the world go by. There is no casual area to have a coffee or snack, just a small lobby with a couple of chairs so if you are staying here for any length of time, you are stuck in your room. There is no pool to go sit by. A previous reviewer stated that their stay was \u201codd\u201d and now I understand why. For two weeks I was able to watch how the staff treat the hotel guests versus the residents of the building and it is very different, in fact, we felt like we were imposing and intruding, we did not feel like hotel guests. The concierge\u2019s were polite but they had this underlying tone and attitude. \nSo we arrive at the Sherry and are greeted by Alvin who collects our bags. We are checked in by the concierge and given a nice welcome until she looks at my passport photo and tells me how much I have aged. Now I just laughed it off, however upon reflection, this lady did not know me and is that appropriate behaviour from a five star hotel? Or maybe it is not a five star hotel, it is a residential building and she became too familiar with us?\nAlvin takes us up to our room and we step out to renovations occurring on the second floor, which is where our room is. The concierge forgot to inform us of this when checking in. Alvin points out that the Business Centre is closed for renovation and lucky for us they have relocated it right next door to our room. Alvin shows us our room, we tip him and he stated that he is a native New Yorker and if we need anything he is around \u2013 we never saw Alvin again until check out two weeks later when he picked up our bags. There was a box of Godiva chocolates and flowers welcoming us. There were also two notes from the management. Both notes had different and incorrect spellings of my name. My booking was made by my travel agent so they had all the details \u2013 oh and my surname, only has four letters and my Christian name is also very easy. \nI wondered about the renovations going on but at that time (it was about 3pm in the afternoon on a weekday) we could not hear any noise, so unpacked and settled in. We were happy. In fact, during the whole two week stay we did not actually hear much of the renovation going on, it is what woke us up each morning. As stated above, there was board on the floor in the hall way stuck together by masking tape. Each night it was removed and every morning (weekday) it was re-laid. So between 8.00 \u2013 8.30am you would hear the ripping of masking tape and while doing this the person laying the board would have a very loud conversation with the housekeeping staff or other tradesmen, right near our room. So rather than wake up naturally, without fail we were woken by the staff of the \u201chotel\u201d. There were mornings on the weekend when I woke up to the housekeeping staff calling out to bring more towels or for a staff member calling for security on her walkie talkie. My tip to the Sherry, if your guest has the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign up and the paper is still outside their door it indicates they are still asleep.\nThe bathroom \u2013 it was small. However, we had a bath, great I thought! Then I looked at the bottom of it, the non-slip surface was fifty shades of grey, there was no way I was sitting on that. It needed to be replaced or given a damn good bleach.\nThis leads me into housekeeping, extremely inconsistent. If a hotel is renovating and it expects its guests to stay within the area during this phase then the housekeeping needs to be vigilant with keeping building dust to a minimum. After about four days I noticed the build up of dust. It is important to note here that there was a lot of drawers and wardrobe space so we did not leave a lot of personal items out on the side cabinets or tables. The housekeeping did not have to move any personal items to dust. By day five I was able to write words into the dust, I wrote \u201chello\u201d on the TV stand and it still did not get cleaned. Day seven it did, only because I happened to be in the room at the time. I am not sure if the bathroom got cleaned, as there was a pubic hair on the daddo by the toilet and stayed there for the full two weeks with all the dust.\nNow there are plenty more examples to provide but the piece de resistance was room service. We had been eating in a lot of restaurants and decided to stay in one night. I said to my husband all I feel like is a toasted cheese sandwich. He rings room service and orders one each. We get our order \u2013 two plates with covers. First thing we notice, only one glass of water, we laugh. Then we lift the lid and were shocked. The toasted sandwich was that, a cheese toasted sandwich. Not what you expect from a five star kitchen: there was no parsley for decoration, no fries, no salad just plain crappy white bread with plastic cheese and the crusts cut off and it was very dry (took a photo of it). Now you are probably saying, yeah, that is what you wanted. Yes but guess what we paid when I asked my husband what the amount was on the bill - $41.00 for two toasted sandwiches and one glass of water. I would not have minded if we got some fries and salad with that. In all my travels and I have been travelling most of my life that would go down as the worst hotel dish I have seen and the biggest RIP OFF! By the way, based on this dish we did not even want to waste our time and money going to the restaurant. \nMy tip if you are staying at the Sherry, go around corner to the deli we got beautiful sushi (spicy crab) for $5.75. Also for the international visitors who may not know, you can take your washing to a dry cleaner and they do it for you, usually one pound of clothing costs about $1.00. We had 44 items of clothing washed and it cost $20.\nBY the way I was happy to put all of this into a customer satisfaction feedback form but there was not one in our room. So with this experience in mind, go to a proper hotel, a place that provides the amenities a hotel of five star standard should. We certainly noticed the difference when we checked in at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills after staying at the Sherry \u2013 now there is a hotel!

Apparently on the pent house floor there are also hospitality suites directly across the hall from the guest suites. By design this is a very poor choice by the hotel as hospitality suites are typically for parties. Yes, we were staying across the hall from a loud drunken open house party! The music was loud, the people were in and out of the suite causing a big disturbance in our suite. A note was slipped under our door by the Party Hostess suggesting that she knew it was loud and that we should join them. This is not at all what we had in mind for our wedding night. At 12:30am when we couldn't take anymore we checked out and found another hotel. The attendant at the front desk was considerate and understanding as we conveyed the issues and didn't charge us for the room. I can only think that the rental price for the Hospitality Suite was much more than our guest suite as no additional solutions to the problem were offered. The whole experience was frustrating.

After much searching with AmEx emergency services (Great job from them as well), The Eventi showed up as the only practical option.\nI travel frequently and I often stay at Kimpton properties because I like their unique designs. I am low-maintenance when I'm on the road and it is rare that the performance of the staff has any significant impact on my stay. After a harrowing five days of urban camping in my powerless and waterless apartment, the Eventi staff took us all in like family, and made the world seem safe and normal again.\nPatrick, Gabriella , and I wish I could remember everyone's names, but suffice it to say that the entire desk and valet staff were phenomenal. Robert, the GM, has pulled together a special group of people. They greeted us warmly and played with our dogs. The next morning, staff that we hadn't even met knew the names of the animals and would greet them by name when I took them out for walks. They offered treats. They even remebered that one dog likes her head scratched and the other one likes his butt scratched. They helped us with dry cleaning and laundry. The housekeeping staff were excellent and had the room spotlessly clean every day - even the fur was gone. When I had to bring a cat from my apartment because she was ill, a filled litter pan and a small bag of cat food was waiting outside the room door when I returned (I never even thought to ask for one). Our menagerie ended up staying for eight days until we confirmed that we would not be able to return to our apartment for several months, and we relocated out of State to stay with family. One night, I was bringing back pizza to eat in the room (from Waldie's - an excellent pie). The doorman saw the box and said \"Aha! You discovered Waldie's. Their pizza is fantastic\". A few minutes later, we were all sharing the pizza in the lobby and laughing and telling stories around the front desk like we had all been friends since college.\nAs for the room: Beautiful. Quite subdued by Kimpton standards, with lots of dark wood and chocolate tones. Very contemporary and elegant. Terrific bed, sheets and pillows.

The hotel and room were meticulously clean and well maintained, which is always my first priority. Location is great, close to subway stops and walking distance to Penn station. Location is of course subjective in NYC, depending on where you need to be.\nWe stayed in a city-view king on the 18th floor. Spectacular views, our room faced east so we had an excellent view of the Empire State Building. Road noise was reasonable during the day and practically non-existent at night with the blinds drawn. HVAC noise was of course present but within a reasonable level. Room was perfectly clean, great condition, and quite sizable by city standards. Bathroom was spacious, modern and functional. My only complaint with the entire property was with the bed. I prefer a really firm mattress and this one was a bit soft for my liking. Actually seemed like the topper could use replacing. That being said we slept fine, pillows and linens were nice.\nWe ate breakfast and dinner in the restaurant and the food was very good. Culinary choices are plentiful in NYC but it\u2019s nice to know that you can also get quality food without leaving the hotel. There\u2019s also a free wine hour in the late afternoon which my wife took advantage of, she commented that it was a great opportunity to meet other travelers.\nThe staff were friendly and attentive. We arrived at around 11AM expecting to just drop off our luggage but they had a room available so we were able to check in immediately. The day we checked out it was raining so I asked the staff were I could get an umbrella. They said we could use the one from the room, even though we were checking out, and to just return it before we left the city. These are just little things that make the stay more enjoyable.\nGreat hotel, great stay, would highly recommend.", "author": {"username": "Jeff128", "num_cities": 3, "num_helpful_votes": 4, "num_reviews": 3, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "D1B05304E01C2916FDAC1141CA2C93B3", "location": "Albany, New York"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "December 3, 2012", "id": 146699142, "via_mobile": false}

Setting this trip in context, we are the parents of a profoundly learning disabled son and we had to negotiate and save our respite care for a year so that we could have our first holiday alone since our honeymoon. This was to be the most luxurious,spoilt treat of our lifetime.\nIn April, we booked the Suite Surrender package staying in an Empire State Suite. The package at that time was similar to the one currently on offer which promised:\n\u2022 The attention of a Personal Assistant, a signature service provided by Capella Hotels and Resorts\n\u2022 A couture kitchen filled with New York City\u2019s finest flavors, stocked once and entirely prior to your arrival\n\u2022 Complimentary refreshment center \n\u2022 A bottle of Taittinger Ros\u00e9 champagne and fresh fruit upon arrival\n\u2022 a $100 Auriga credit per night for treatments in-suite or in the luxurious Auriga spa. \n\u2022 Complimentary pressing of up to 5 items and shoe shine on the date of your arrival\nUnlike the current offer, we were not promised the Bergdorf Goodman voucher but instead a luxury breakfast delivered daily to our suite. \nI specified that I wanted a room on as high a floor as possible and emphasised that this was a special occasion.\nWe were waiting for the call from our personal assistant prior to our arrival, but the call didn't come.\nOn arrival at the hotel, the door men did not open the door as we struggled through with our luggage and with only one member of staff on duty at reception joined the line to check in. Things started to look up when we were told we had been upgraded as this was a special occasion and we were allocated room 2702. Bizarrely,we were walked to the elevator and whilst in the elevator the promise of pressed clothes was explained -surely this should have been done at the reception desk? \nStill, we headed to our room, excited about our upgrade. This was an eagerly anticipated stay, so I had devoured the website and all of the photos, so when I entered the City one bedroom suite I was disappointed. This was NOT and upgrade but a DOWN grade. Although this suite was bigger in square footage, it was a cheaper suite. We looked for the bottle of champagne and fruit but there was none. We looked in the fridge for the finest flavours of NYC and found 6 small bottles of soda a bottle of water and four milk creamers for coffee.\nI was gutted.\ni phoned down to reception but no-one answered. I phoned the personal assistant line only to told it was nothing to do with them and I needed to contact reception. I explained I could not get through and asked if the city room was a lower grade room than an empire room, I was told by the personal assistant that it was a downgrade and she put me on hold and eventually through to reception. No apology was forthcoming for the poor service in fact I felt reprimanded for challenging the upgrade and was told that the suites had been renamed since I booked and that I indeed had an upgrade. Strange though that the same names are advertised currently on the website and that indeed, the empire suite is about $300 a night more expensive that our city room.\nThe receptionist said she would send up the missing elements of our package when it was checked out. We were by now exhausted, having been travelling for over 21 hours. We had just wanted to crack open the champagne, drink to our anniversary and get some rest. We waited over an hour for the delivery and then decided to get some sleep as the goods were clearly not coming. Half an hour into our sleep the door was persistently knocked. My husband had to get up, dress and answer the door to receive:\n the bottle of champagne\n the fresh fruit - this was in fact a small plate of sliced fruit salad.\n a wine glass with more fresh fruit salad and plain yoghurt\n a dish of nuts\n three one oz pieces of cheese on a tray\n a four pack of beer\n a four pack of root beer.\n~Sorry, but do these latter 4 items classify as New York's finest flavors? In a five star hotel, I was expecting a lot more. AND they did NOT stock the fridge, they barely filled one shelf.\nOn rising on Sunday 28th October, we headed to Ai Fiori with our complimentary breakfast vouchers. Again, we had been promised luxury breakfasts in our room, instead we were given 6 continental breakfast vouchers for a muffin, croissant and danish with orange juice and a coffeee. Hardly luxury. Even this was poorly served. We submitted our vouchers and then were billed $60. We finished our coffees and had to ask for a refill. My husband called over the waiter, he went for the coffee pot, then filled my husband's cup and walked away leaving my cup empty. Surely, a Michelin starred restaurant has heard of silver service?\nWe headed out into Manhattan. We would have loved at this point to have had our personal assistant organise a ride in the Maserati as we were heading to Tiffanys to get a ring to celebrate our occasion, but as for the entire duration of our stay, we were not allocated a personal assistant \"the signature service provided,\" therefore we did not get that opportunity.\nOn no occasion, did any member of staff apology for the lack of service or the failure to provide what was being paid for. All of these issues are basic customer care issues, a product was ordered and it was down to the staff of the Setai to deliver, but this was a total failure.\nSubsequent issues resulted from the skeleton staff in situ.\nWhen we arrived back in the hotel after our few hours in Manhattan, we picked up the letter stating that due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Sandy, we would not have a housekeeping service. So we did not have any of the snacks delivered each afternoon that previous guests have raved about. We did not have any amenities replaced - i.e. soaps, and when we ran out of Nespresso capsules it took 3 requests and 9 hours before we had them delivered. We appreciate that staff were under pressure by this time, but we offered to collect the capsules from reception on two occasions and on each we were told they would be sent up to our room, without any apology. Ironically, they arrived 30 minutes before the power outage.\nOn Monday, we had no restaurant service and had to eat in the bar. In the evening, we were provided with a buffet dinner at a cost of $25 per person. Two choices of main course, one potato, one veg. Considering the conditions,$25 was taking advantage.\nBy Monday night, the power was out and so we were in darkness, no elevators (Essential on the 27th floor), no hot water in the morning and bread, cheese and ham for breakfast. \nIn summation, during our luxury break we had:\n A downgraded room - one bedroom suite instead of Empire state - which had been specifically requested\n No personal assistant service\n One turndown service\n No daily clean of suite for entire stay\n None of the promised surrender package (until minimum arrived after complaint)\n No breakfast in suite\n Use of the Nespresso machine for one out of three days (due to lack of capsules)\n One breakfast in Ai Fiori\n Power and hot water for two out of three nights.\nYet, we were billed the full amount for our stay of over $3400. We did mention the lack of the suite surrender package, specifically mentioning the lack of the spa vouchers and were cheekily told that we could have the vouchers. What use would they have been with the spa closed and the power out?\nWe were offered a 50% reduction on the cost of our final night - the one with no power, water or food, which we did take BUT we were greatly under stress by this point. We had just been told our flight was cancelled, our son was due home with noone to care for him and we had to find a hotel in a city where 9000 flights had been cancelled stranding many others in a similar situation. With hindsight, we were sold short. We should been paying the cost of a one bedroom suite -without the package, we should have had the $100 per night spa voucher returned along with $120 the apparent cost of the four breakfasts we did not get. Without basic housekeeping we should have received some compensation. Our lifetime holiday- an opportunity we will NEVER have again, was in ruins. Not due to Sandy, but due to uncaring, inhospitable staff. \nWe are very understanding of the difficult situation that staff were put in when NYC went into close down, but it needs to be stated that in our \"new\" hotel, the Westin Grand Central, we were made to feel very welcome, we were given free coffee when we arrived to check if they had room, they gave us free wifi for our entire stay to allow us to get in contact with home to make arrangements for our son and they had such a friendly outlook that staff in the Setai could learn from. \nThis was sent to the Setai management and a phonecall to discuss this has been promised, but as yet has not happened. It appears from subsequent reviews that our experience was not unique yet others seem to have a magical time.

They recommend a few local shops and food places if we wanted to pass the time.

I do not cope well with confined spaces etc but the speed of the lifts was excellent and I managed to survive the constant use! :). We arrived at our room and it appeared we had been given a larger room (possibly because I emailed in advance) and we also received a complimentary bottle of wine and box of chocolates which was a lovely touch. The room was excellent, large, spacious, very clean with more than enough storage. The views from our huge window were fantastic! The concierge were attentive and informative without being pushy (this was my partners 6th time in NYC and they did not feel the need to tell her anything as she had good local knowledge). \nEven though NYC pretty much shut down for a few days, the housekeeping service was still available (albeit on a reduced staff) and they were very polite. If you are there for a few nights (we were for 5) I would recommend that on your first morning to leave a $10 dollar tip and a note to housekeeping then leave $2/$3 for the duration of your stay and you will end up with plenty of extra toiletries/towels/pillows etc or anything else you may need. \nThe hotel staff kept all guests up to date with information regarding local facilities that were still available during the hurricane. \nWe were both very impressed with Hotel Beacon and the staff and will certainly be planning on staying there again when we visit again next year.

Tried putting AC on high for a while to change the air but it didn't do much of a difference. Other than that small inconvenience, bed clean, very comfortable and couldn't ask for anything else.

The hotel was pleasant enough, but a bit overrated in my opinion, mostly due to inconsistent service. My brother also happened to be staying at the hotel, using the same flash sale but for a longer stay, so we were able to compare our experiences. His room was actually directly above ours.\nFirst off, I would have to say this is not my favourite New York neighbourhood--5th Ave. between 36th and 37th. While such tourist sites as the Empire State Building, Macy's and Lord and Taylor are nearby, I prefer the sites and shops on or near 5th Ave. 15-25 blocks north-- Saks, Barneys, the Top of the Rock, MOMA. Bryant Park, the NY Public Library and the Morgan Library are also nearby. When we walked from the hotel toward Times Square to catch a play (\"The Heiress\"), we walked down a street (37th?) that had store after store of cheesy discount evening gowns.\nThe hotel itself is lovely, occupying the lower floors of a 57 story building designed by Gwathmey Siegel, who did the Guggenheim Museum's addition. This was one of Charles Gwathmey's last projects before his untimely passing. Perhaps most unique are the hotel's angular windows that open to let in a decent amount of fresh air. The lobby is more like a foyer, not really a space to sit and relax, but has some nice design touches, especially the curved stairway leading to the 2nd floor restaurant (A Fiori) and the pendulous teardrop-like sculpture in its centre. The Bar on Fifth, where one can sit and relax, is just beyond the lobby. The hotel has a flexible check-in/check-out policy, so when we arrived rather early after our red-eye flight, our room was ready. A very kind and friendly bellman escorted us to the room and remembered and acknowledged us whenever we passed by later on.\nOur room was a Standard Room, the lowliest of room categories. It was actually quite spacious by New York standards (420 sq. feet), with almost half the space occupied by the sumptuously appointed bathroom, leaving the bedroom area a bit cramped. The next room category up, the Superior room, has the same square footage but a larger bedroom and smaller bath. The room was sleekly designed in shades of brown and beige, with wood paneling. The view was a \"courtyard\" view of the backsides of buildings that faced 36th or 37th St.--there was actually a good amount of natural light, and the bathroom also had a window, All windows were floor to ceiling. The bath had a dual head shower (rain or hand-held) over the tub. \nWhat I liked:\nThe complimentary Nespresso machine and refreshment centre (minifridge with sodas and water--no minibar). The high definition TV. The aforementioned angular windows. The nicely designed door jam that is a refreshingly modern alternative to the standard chain and bolt. The bath toiletries. The large WC alcove.\nWhat was less impressive:\nThe highly touted Duxiana bed was low-slung--a box spring topped by what looked like a mattress topper but no mattress (A peek at the Duxiana website shows that this is in fact one of their bed's designs--the \"magic\" apparently is in the number of springs in the base. Yes, it was comfortable, but not out of this world). Only 2 king pillows--4 would have been nice. Only one hand towel and one face cloth, but 2 bath towels and 2 bath sheets. The WC alcove could have used a door. Our shower curtain was full-length, but the one in my brother's room was at least a foot short of the tub ledge, leaving a frightfully dangerous, slippery wet marble surface after showering--a lawsuit waiting to happen. The TV is not wall-mounted, but rather sits on top of the desk, usurping valuable space. There is free Wifi, but no one told me you needed a password. The closet in the Standard rooms are not full length. The bedside cordless phones are hard to operate. The desk phone has a large lighted screen than cannot be dimmed while sleeping. We did not receive morning newspaper delivery, nor did my brother on any day. My brother got cookies with turndown, we got water from the refreshment centre. After we had checked-in (early), we spent an hour or so in the room, during which time the housekeeping staff and others could clearly be heard going about their business. At least 3 people tried to enter the room, only one knocked (luckily we had the door jam engaged). We heard a lot of doors opening and closing--it turned out the room across the way from ours was being used as a housekeeping storage room. A stairway door was also nearby.\nOur package included breakfast (a set value to be used in the restaurant or in-room), which we took in the restaurant--quite nice. Interestingly, for some selections, one is not served potatoes, but always a small salad. We also had late night room service (club sandwiches)-- also quite nice, and again with salads instead of carbs. There is a spa and salon that occupies the 4th floor, but we did not try these services. The fitness centre is on the 3rd floor (although the elevators say its on the 4th), as is the business centre--2 small key-accessed rooms housing computers and printers.\nIf this hotel was situated in an area more suited to my likings, it would definitely be on the list of possible accommodations. Even now, I would consider a return visit, but the luxury hotel milieu in Manhattan is highly competitive and somewhat large, so the Setai must pay attention to every detail to stay in the game.", "author": {"username": "pillowsofwanderlust", "num_cities": 20, "num_helpful_votes": 231, "num_reviews": 57, "num_type_reviews": 49, "id": "3F88F8D4F220EFE6418ED0B22AAF03E6", "location": "Los Angeles CA"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "November 22, 2012", "id": 145940048, "via_mobile": false}

We stayed with what we knew and have not been dissappointed.\nThe executive floor was under renovation but this did not detract from our stay. We had a very comfortable room - twin queen beds, large work area, big bathroom, all the needed facilities - tea, coffee, iron, toiletries and safe. Ceramic cups would be better than the paper ones for the room though.\nThe staff made our stay this time round. The valet was great - parking to allow us to get situated etc.., Guest Services exceptional - quick, efficient and polite. Requests for fridge, bathrobe, unblocking toilet, toilet paper, towels and linen were all effectively handled and we did not feel like we were \"bothering\" them - to the contrary - \"we are happy to help to make sure your stay is memorable\". And this over Thanksgiving! We were also given free wifi as our Thankgiving gift. The first receptionist we dealt with was a bit iffie. Her supervisor corrected her deficiencies.\nParking at $30 per night is very expensive. We were transported by my daughter and did not need a car. However, casual parking for her was expensive at $8 per 2 hours. The hotel does offer a good shuttle service to downtown (Macy's etc) and will fetch you. This was really appreciated. \nWe will be back to see my daughter and husband and will stay here again if possible.", "author": {"username": "Rob N", "num_cities": 15, "num_helpful_votes": 36, "num_reviews": 31, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "8DBE6B92BDAB99A83D1F8DB8EA56C6AA", "location": "Johannesburg, South Africa"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 25, 2012", "id": 146186982, "via_mobile": false}

The quality of materials in the room exceeds your typical Marriott room. Large LG flat screen TV, good carpets, good drapes, fixtures, etc. all of nice quality. Great 4 cup coffee maker.\nBathroom: Good size, nice granite counters, huge Jacuzzi tub, huge shower with the best water pressure I have ever experienced. Tub and shower were clean, but Jacuzzi was very hard to activate; a maintenance man showed us how to turn it on by repeatedly using shallow pushes to the start button. Also, several jets came off while using the tub. It\u2019s a nice feature but was not maintained. \nBed: Very good bed. \nHouskeeping: Average. We left a tip requested extra bath towels. Housekeeping took the tip but did not leave towels. \nRestaurants: We cannot recommend the hotel restaurant. We had the full breakfast buffet on Thanksgiving morning. Both the food and staff were sub-par. The buffet was not restocked, and we had to scavenge the dregs of what remained. Several core items were out of stock on the buffet including jam and fruit. The bacon was swimming in grease. We finally asked the staff to bring us fruit, and they did. However, the staff\u2019s attitude was lackadaisical at best. We even had to get up to get our own water after waiting an extended period of time.

And the valets were very knowledgeable about downtown and restaurants. Use caution at night downtown. There are many bums in this part of downtown. I worked nearby at Pennzoil Place (about 5 blocks away) in the late 90s, and never noticed bums during the day. But they are everywhere at night, even urinating in public.

The building is beautiful, I believe it was a bank at one time, and you can still see the old vault behind the reception area. There are various room configurations, so make sure you know what you are getting when you book. They have accessible rooms, which is great if you require this access, but not so great if you don\u2019t need it. There is no pool at this hotel, and they have no agreements with any local hotels for access to their pool. It would have been nice for a cool down after a hot day, but not a deal breaker, if you're there on business.\nI found my room to be clean and the furnishings in excellent condition. I had a corner room, so I had lots of windows and light. The ceilings are nice and high, which adds to the feeling of space. There is a large desk, and Wi-Fi is free, so it\u2019s great for business travelers. I had a very comfortable King bed in my room and the pillows were OK, but they did get a bit flat after a few hours, so I had to use two. \nThe TV reception was sketchy \u2013 most of the lower channels were all snow, and there were not too many to choose from.\nThe bathroom was huge! My bathroom had a large walk-in shower, but no tub. The water pressure was good, and I never ran out of hot water. There was a standard shower head and a rain shower fixture. A colleague was also staying at this hotel, and she had a tub in her bathroom, so it sounds like there are multiple bathroom configurations, too. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash are in a dispenser, and a bar of soap is included for the sink area. Good sized vanity, with lots of space for toiletries, and a lighted makeup mirror. You can get a hair dryer on request.\nI was here for a conference, and I found the hotel staff friendly and helpful, the room clean and well suited for my needs, and the location convenient for everything I needed to do. \nThere is a restaurant at the hotel - The Line & Lariat. It is a really nice restaurant, and the food is very good. Breakfast is great and the service at breakfast was exemplary. Lunch service is at the bar, and was also excellent. I had the crab cakes for lunch and they were really good.\nDiner service, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I was seated promptly by the hostess, who had a bright, beautiful smile, and served me my water right away. 15 minutes later, I had lots of time to peruse the small menu, but I still hadn\u2019t seen a server. While the menu is not large, it does have good variety, with some unusual dishes tossed in. The supervisor finally came over and took my order, apologizing for the waitress who was quite busy. I found this rather strange, as there was a large conference in town, and there were lots of attendees staying at the hotel. You would think they would have made sure their staffing levels were sufficient to properly serve guests. Anyway, I ordered the Bryan Farms chicken, which was delicious. About 15 minutes after my order was taken, my server walked by an introduced herself on the way by. No apology for the slow service, just her name (which I promptly forgot) and that she would take care of me for the rest of the evening. That was the last time I saw her. It took about 20 minutes for my food to arrive, not completely unreasonable, but I was never offered any bread, even though I saw bread baskets on most of the other tables. I was only drinking water, and I had to flag down a bus person and ask before I got my water refreshed. \nAfter dinner, I sat with an empty plate for about 10 minutes before my empty dishes were cleared, again by the supervisor. The supervisor left my table with my dishes, then remembered to return and ask me if I wanted to order desert \u2013 which I did. Serving tables was obviously not this guy\u2019s job, but I have to give him an A for effort \u2013 he really did try. I had some chocolate concoction which was really sweet and very yummy! I never did get a refill of my coffee, even though I sat with an empty cup for about 15 minutes. I finally gave up and got up to leave. I had to ask the hostess to get my bill so I could pay it as I never did see anyone at my table again so I could to ask for it. \nAll in all, food was great, service appears to be somewhat inconsistent.", "author": {"username": "DorisBH", "num_cities": 27, "num_helpful_votes": 24, "num_reviews": 63, "num_type_reviews": 19, "id": "EC5CCE0DCFEF25BCB2D3FE9290D83E4A", "location": "Airdrie, Canada"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 283873, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 24, 2012", "id": 146108400, "via_mobile": false}

When I called the desk, they couldn't tell me how to fix it, you got it, they'd send a maid up to check it out. All that, for a price that was above average. I have to say though, that the staff was this surreal type of friendly. Like they were programmed with the same friendly responses. Better than being yelled and smirked at I guess? To their defense, the woman who booked the room for me was very accommodating. She got permission for my 60 lb. dog to stay when they usually only accept dogs under 35lbs. Of course there was an additional charge, and restrictions, but was pleased she went the extra step to allow my dog. Nice property all-in-all if you are wanting something with more personality. Absolutely loved that they had a Texas rubber duck waiting for you in the bathroom with some great soaps. The rooms was very cozy and relaxing. The city view was beautiful. The location was great for downtown nightlife and there was a nice park/walking area two blocks away, which my dog loved. I'd stay there again.

I was attending a convention at the nearby George Brown Convention Center.\nThis was my second visit to Houston, and by and large I can see a huge difference. The area around the Convention Center has been cleaned up (and that includes the hotel location). They've planted a park with trees, flowers, a pond and even a tea house. So Houston is definitely moving beyond its image of being a city of heat, dust and ugly concrete. The walk from the hotel to the Convention Center is short, and crosses part of the new park, so overall it feels like being in the same complex. This is a great plus and Houston is a city that is very spread out and where you can easily lose a lot of time travelling, even to places that are supposedly close by.\nThe hotel is also well located for other attractions in Downtown Houston. The main shopping street is just some blocks away (but honestly speaking not all that interesting, so I wouldn't go there). There are a number of neat bars some of the back streets around the hotel so those are well worth popping into. Also around the corner is the Houston Pavillions, a collection of themed restaurants and music bars all in one building. So you'll have no trouble spending your free time when you're here. I also recommend taking a walk around some of the older parts of Houston which are roughly North and West of the hotel. Personally I was impressed by the different architectural and historical styles. Most recommendable is the Gulf Building (also called Morgan Chase Building) which is an architectural landmark (you can go on a tour). They also seem to be cleaning other parts of Houston up as there is quite a lot of building and renovation going on and much of the ugliness there used to be is gone. One down side, and this has definitely increased since last time I was in Houston, is the number of homeless people and beggars roaming the streets, carrying their belongings in big bags. You see them all day but they seems to get more at night. They aren't dangerous or aggressive but it's still a sorry and uncomfortable sight.\nAnother thing I can recommend is taking a ride on the Metro. Despite what it's name suggests this is not a traditional metro with tunnels but a streetcar that runs through the streets of Houston and is an interesting way to see different parts of the city, passing several major parks, green areas, universities and other points of interest, and is also a great venue for people watching.\nThe hotel is quite easy to find. The architecture is a bit nondescript, but difficult to miss nonetheless. The doors were opened for me by a doorman and the receptionist helped me immediately. Besides the hotels and bars I mentioned previously, the hotel has several bars/restaurants of its own. I later tried the one downstairs. Although it was very late at the time (I guess it must have been the early hours of the morning), I was surprised they could still get me something to eat. The choice of drinks was also surprisingly good for a hotel bar and the barman very professional and knowledgeable about it. It was a bit lacking in atmosphere though as most other people there were serious business types and they went to bed quite early.\nThe hotel has a gym and even an outdoor pool but I only had a quick look at those as I didn't have time for more. Especially the pool did look very inviting, so if I ever come back I'll try and spend some time there. My room was higher up. The view from the window was idionymous with what much of Houston is about. In the foreground a massive expanse of derelict land, temporarily used for car parking, further away some buildings that looked as if they were soon to be torn down. I later discovered there are many more places like these. This is the surreal contrast that typifies Houston: Fancy hotels and many modern skyscrapers that are the HQs of multinationals, and right next door derelict plots and ruined buildings. It makes me wonder how the economics of all that works, and why the people who own what must be very expensive land don't do anything with it. \nThe room itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The bed was comfortable though and everything was clean. I didn't check out the minibar, but the ice cubes were filled up every day. Despite being in the middle of Houston, the room was very quiet and I think i slept very well. The bathroom was very tastefully designed, with lots of patterned tiles emanating a warm feeling, making you want to spend a lot of time there.\nI think the rooms have free WiFi, but I didn't get around to testing that. \nAll in all, the hotel was very well run. The staff were good, the hotel was extremely clean and I can find no fault with any part of it. The interior decoration is on the whole tasteful and makes you feel at ease. The location is also good.", "author": {"username": "Andy M", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 8, "num_type_reviews": 3, "id": "13119ED019F28C84291FF50D2C4C5515", "location": "Zurich, Switzerland"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 98952, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "November 5, 2012", "id": 144590752, "via_mobile": false}

The problems I had with the hotel are the same problems many reviewers have noted, which concerns me since they don't appear to be being addressed. I'll start with the cons (problem areas): 1) Check-in in has major issues - I initially attempted to check in at 11 am, there was no room available so they took our bags and told us to come back. They said they would work on getting us a high room as I requested. I ended up getting a room on the 4th floor...not high in my book, but I'm assuming it is the highest they had available. Anyhow, they called at around 4 to let me know my room was ready. We came back in the early evening to check in and that is when things took a turn. Check in was chaotic despite the fact that there was only one other couple checking in at the same time. The young man asked us for our name, handed us our key and that was it. No description of the property or amenities, no maps or questions about why we were visiting, no introduction or mention of the concierge, no offer to help us with our bags, nothing. The whole ordeal was a bit cold and unprofessional. 2) The staff is very young and trendy, which fits the hotel vibe, and always smile, but there is just a warmth that is missing. There also seems to be a real lack of organization. The staff always seem to be running around, but not necessarily helping you when you need it. Out of the three days we were there, a staff member opened the front door for us 1 time. That is unacceptable when I am paying $400 a night. I highly recommend management start instituting stations that people must man at all times instead of running around frantically. A person at the front door at all times and a person at the check-in desk at all times is a must. 3) No closet space. The hotel is trendy, I get it and I've stayed at other hotels with similar concepts, but none with this little storage space. No drawers and only a tiny glass closet space to hang a few item and 4) the bed was ok, definitely not the comfiest I've ever slept in.\nPros: Room was very, very clean and the view of the public library was nice. The minibar in the room was a nice touch since it offered free snacks and non-alcoholic drinks. The room was quiet despite facing 5th avenue.

Second complaint, we needed cabs on several occasions, nobody offered to get us a cab at first, then I remembered this happened twice--after we stood outside for like 5 minutes, someone finally came to help us, but was either at the same time chatting with someone else, or really not trying as hard as I'd like to.

When we arrived, they unfortunately were closed due to heating problems caused by Hurricane Sandy so we had to go elsewhere for our first night. The staff on duty were very apologetic and assisted us in getting to another hotel.\nThankfully, we were able to return on day two, so spent the rest of our trip there. We had booked a Capella room and asked for a high floor. We stayed in room 1401 which was massive......and I mean huge! The bed was six foot wide and was lost in the room. We overlooked Fifth Avenue and the Chrysler Building. The room had a decent sized seating area with a sofa and two armchairs and the bed. There was a dressing room which had two double open wardrobes and drawers. This then lead into a huge marble bathroom, with twin basins and plenty of countertop space. Shower was vast with two shower heads. You honestly have to see this room to appreciate the space. I do not like small hotel rooms and hate when your cases sit in the corner on open view, which serves to remind that you are going home.....no issues here though - suitcases were well hidden from view.\nThe Bar on Fifth has a nice, relaxed atmosphere and has jazz bands playing every night.\nLocation of the hotel is great for going to the various sights of NYC in both lower and midtown Manhattan.\nHad a serious personal issue during stay. Brian Fahey, Concierge Manager, was absolutely fabulous with his assistance. He always made sure that he kept up to date with the situation and it helped me feel a little more relaxed. \nManaged to use the hotel car (a Maserati) a couple of times - nice touch of luxury.\nOur room was right next to the lift shaft but we could not hear any noises. The room is at the end of the corridor with one other room and is a fair distance away from other rooms, so no disruptions from others walking past.\nDid not eat in the hotel (apart from room service late one night, which was good). Plenty of coffee shops, etc nearby for breakfasts.\nThe Nespresso machine and complimentary mini bar (soft beverages) was a nice touch. Have been in plenty of high end hotels which did not have this. There have been some previous comments bout these not being replenished when used but a quick call to Guest Services soon sort that out.\nWould definitely recommend to others and would stay here again on our return.", "author": {"username": "Pauline010", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 25, "num_reviews": 17, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "238339A2F15AFC70E42ED9DF7F19E04A", "location": "Aberdeen, UK"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "November 17, 2012", "id": 145595784, "via_mobile": false}

We actually never figured out one of the lights so we just unscrewed the lightbulbs every night. On our second day we requested and received an orientation, which was very helpful, so we could used all of the \"special features\" of the toilet. In case it appears we are completely inept, we are not....the toilet actually had to be reset so that the bidet features would work. But the toilet still malfunctioned twice in our three-day visit so that engineering had to come to reset it. So it was a little too high tech for our tastes. Also, we paid for the terrace, which is completely useless unless you are a smoker. Otherwise you would not want to spend time there since it is close to the HVAC unit so very noisy and no view. Lastly, both bars and the restaurant were completely unavailable beginning at 4pm on one of our nights because the Food Network was using the location.

The breakwast was also light, hence the name \"continental breakfast,\" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel's location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming.

Very nice furnishings, clean and well-maintained. 2 big TVs; docking station for iPods. Our low-floor room was great given that the elevators can be slow. I never knew about the laundry room that others have mentioned here; I add that to the list of things the staff couldn't be bothered with telling us. Along with: no parking garage within 10 blocks will let you park overnight over Thanksgiving (we ended up at Lincoln Center 12 blocks away, on a tip from a guy at the 6th garage we tried); even though checkin is at 3pm, that doesn't necessarily mean 3, it might mean 4:30; (because \"it's really busy\" - now I know to only expect what I pay for when it's slow). I know it's been a while since I've been to NY, because I noticed the lack of pleasantries, such as \"good morning\" from a doorman or \"Did you enjoy you stay?\" from the front desk. Ah well. It's a nice place and you'll love it if you want to stay in a quieter part of the city, without being too far away from things. Fairway across the street; Starbucks on the corner; liquor store next door.

Patrick at the front desk gave me an upgrade so that I wouldn't have to wait for my room to be ready, and a $15 free mini-bar card for becoming an In Touch Member. Kevin in Maintenance was also a big help.\n3. The shower is bright and big and has a wonderful rain-shower head as well as a hand-held shower-head. (unfortunately, the floor was very slippery when wet!! Not a good thing)\n4. Beautiful, big, flat screen, high-def TV.\n5. Excellent hair dryer.\n6. Large closet with plenty of hangers, shelves, and a safe. Robes to use if you want.\n7. Big full-length mirror.\nNow the BAD things:\n The room is INSANELY DARK after the sun goes down. I needed my flashlight to unpack my suitcase and to work at the desk. And trying to get them to bring an extra lamp was like pulling teeth!! I had to basically beg many different people, before someone was able to finally find a lamp!\nThere is a nice 8 foot long desk and chair, but the unusual desk light illuminates only a tiny rectangle of space on the desk, leaving the rest of the desk in darkness. Same problem with the night table lamp that just shines directly down on a small area. And the only other lights in the room are two micro-mini recessed ceiling lights over by the window that each shine a narrow, angled beam of light directly onto the curtains. The fact that the majority of the walls are dark brown adds to the problem.\nBelieve me, I'm all for saving electricity, but there are other ways to save electricity. In ACCOR HOTELS for example, the lights will not go on unless you put your room key in a special slot by the door when you enter. So when you go out, and take your key, it is impossible to leave the lights on.\nAs I was looking through the items in the Mini-bar to use my gift card, I noticed that almost all the drinks and food items were expired. And in addition to snacks, the Mini-Bar also had items like a 3-Pack of CONDOMS, and PERSONAL LUBRICANT for sale! I was offended and disgusted! I would expect to see things like that at a seedy motel that you rent by the hour! \nI'm used to reaching into the night table to read the Bible before going to bed (all Hilton Hotels have Bibles).

Outstanding experience!\u201d", "text": "We just returned from our one night mini-vacay from NYC, and I can't wait to write about our experience staying at the San Carlos Hotel. My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. \nFirst of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a \"home\" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn't care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. \nThe amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don't worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! \nFinally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. \nOn Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn't want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations. We are looking forward to going back soon!", "author": {"username": "Eve B", "num_reviews": 2, "id": "E9022F291A01CDAC24DDF6F16C8DFA96", "location": "Herndon, Virginia, United States", "num_helpful_votes": 3}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "October 7, 2012", "id": 142253553, "via_mobile": false}

We had a 12th floor executive suite facing 50th avenue, from 13 to 19 September.\nHotel location is OK, many restaurants at walking distance, 2 blocks away from subway station, lots of groceries stores nearby, friendly reception staff. Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.\nThe suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. \nBed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them \"double-glazed\"), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.\nBreakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.\nThe San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.", "author": {"username": "Gabriel C", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 21, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 15, "id": "9B330AB13A6C8D282E82CD1BEC042156", "location": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 80112, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 22, 2012", "id": 140920753, "via_mobile": false}

I agree with a previous reviewer, I did not want to leave and joked with the front desk I would call a real estate agent! Well, the Sherry does indeed have one, and her name is Theresa Nocerino. If you are in the market for a pied a terre, be sure to give her a call. Everyone at the hotel and in Cipriani's just raved about her.

It's in an area adjacent to I-45, just a few blocks from the edge of the downtown office towers. About a 4 block walk. But that 4 block walk, and however many more to your destination within downtown, can be brutal during the searingly hot and humid period between early June and late September. It's location is immediately adjacent to Freedman's Town in the 4th ward, an area just beginning to transition from old, delapidated wooden homes and bad street surfaces to \"gentrification\". Walking some of the streets late night might not be prudent. There is a secure parking area to the front and the rear of the property.\nAll of the rooms are suite-sized, much larger than is typical. Lots of room. Room decor is a step up from the usual blandness of most hotels, quite attractive. The room and bath were super clean. Carpet is just a bit frayed though. The beds are very comfy and soft, which I prefer. Some don't. Had a very nice white comforter, not one of those nasty bedspread things.\nThere's a microwave and refrigerator in each room. And a 42\" HDTV. BUT... no HDTV service. Go figure. They spent more than is normal in designing and furnishing the rooms, then won't bother to pay for HDTV service.\nThe bath was very clean, but average in size and design. The towels were excellent, very fluffy. BUT... no exhaust vent. Why do so many mid-to-upscale hotels not install bathroom exhaust vents?\nThe air conditioner was very efficient and quick in establishing whatever temperature we set it for. And was very quiet in doing so. Had an excellent nights sleep. \nThere's a nice pool, but it's situated a bit oddly. Most of the pool and surrounding lounging area are under the hotel's second floor, with no sun access. There is one small area at one end of the pool that does get sun from midday until early evening.\nThere is an excellent full breakfast. Which is fortunate since there's no nearby dining or shopping places.\nAll in all, a very good place to sleep well near downtown, but it's very overpriced. After all, it's just a Best Western Plus. For the same price or a few bucks more a room can be booked at nearby hotels that are actually within downtown such as the Doubletree.", "author": {"username": "xplorers2", "num_cities": 16, "num_helpful_votes": 14, "num_reviews": 20, "num_type_reviews": 17, "id": "E71C97C29E8706B074C79CB58EE63D3D", "location": "Spring, TX"}, "date_stayed": "June 2012", "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "June 4, 2012", "id": 131281559, "via_mobile": false}

The garage is on the left-hand side of the building if you're facing the hotel. The garage feels a little sketchy.

It had been a few years since our last stay and apparently it had become more popular since then because of all the good reviews. I guess it is a hidden gem no more! My grown daughters say that they will stay no where else when they are in New York City. Once again, the San Carlos did not disappoint.\nWhen we arrived, Gabriel (I think-no name tags) at the desk immediately greeted us with humor. Since it was my husband with me and our two daughters, he referred to my husband as \"Charlie\" the entire time and we were the \"angels\". We had booked a standard two queen bed room but Gabriel said that we were in a king room suite with a small kitchen at the same rate. I asked about the bed situation and he said that if my daughters were unhappy with the sofabed that we could switch. He assured them that the matresses were new and comfortable. \nOur suite was very spacious and we loved the kitchen area. We seemed to be facing out to a street but it was very quiet in our room. Besides the kitchen space, we had a little table and chairs area, two closets, a desk, two comfortable cushy chairs and a big screen TV plus the king bed! So nice for NYC. And my daughters never had a single complaint about the sofabed. I always especially like the real plants in the room and the roman shades. It seems to give such a homey touch. The bathroom was also spacious with robes, toiletries, plenty of towels and a makeup mirror, etc. We couldn't think of anything they didn't provide. \nEveryone as usual was very pleasant and friendly, always greeting us when we came and went. My husband was especially pleased with how quick the bellman got our luggage up to our room-even before we left the front desk. He had to track him down to give him his tip. We saw the umbrellas lined up as usual on a rainy day but we had our own. Everyone always provided help with our questions when asked. My husband enjoys the fact that he can set up transportation to and from the airport through the San Carlos before our trip. I love the scale in the lobby to weigh your suitcases before your flight-which they do for you if you want! I travel a lot and don't see a scale very often in a hotel lobby. A nice touch since I always want to know what mine weigh before I get to the airport.\nWe love the San Carlos for its amenities and spaciousness but also for its location to 5th Ave. (a few blocks walk straight up) and the subway lines (right on the corner). We also found a great Mexican restaurant on the next block behind the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is a little lacking in variety but that doesn't bother us because we are getting FREE breakfast in NYC!!\nWhen we left, Gabriel joked with us once more and gave us free pens to take. We noticed a small boy coming in after us and he immediately started to show him a magic trick. We had to laugh! The San Carlos always makes us feel welcome and like we are part of the family returning for a visit.

No noise from lifts or other rooms despite hotel being full. Its not trendy - its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well.\nThe location is great - two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven - or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue. 10 minute walk to Empire State.

The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC, the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests, they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations, they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet, and despite having to sleep at work, the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat.\nWe must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add!) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations. \nPatrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful. Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC.\nAMAZING.

What he actually sent me were vouchers for continental breakfast which is of a lower value. I had to call again to set this issue clear and finally get the correct vouchers. Unlike other hotels were they offer the most generous breakfasts at the Setai they are extremely stingy. Full breakfast to them is 2 eggs, 1 sausage, coffee and 1 Juice. For anything else you get charged extra. The free wifi is extremely slow we paid the 15 dollar extra per day. They have all the disney channels apart from Disney Junior, so that they can charge 3.99 or something for 30 minute shows for pre-schoolers. We were never told of the courtesy car they have - they never offered it to us. The room was not being cleaned thoroughly. They change sheets every 3 days. My son had smudged the floor to ceiling mirror in the closet area, those smudges stayed there for 3 days.

I chose this hotel because it is branded as a five stars hotel, because of the flexible check-in and checkout times and finally because of the good reviews on this website. Unfortunately, even though there were positives during my stay at the Setai, it did not reach my expectations for many reasons.\nI\u2019ll start with the negatives.\nFirst, they pretend on their website that the hotel has flexible check-in and checkout times. In the hotel\u2019s guide inside my suite, it\u2019s also clearly written that \u00abthere\u2019s no check in and checkout times at the Setai\u00bb and that guests can request a late checkout for their date of departure. Unfortunately, this is not true. I booked this hotel for this reason because I was landing in New-York in early afternoon and leaving in the evening and I didn\u2019t want to wait hours at the hotel bar to wait for check in. Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened. I arrived at the hotel just before 1h00PM and they told me at the reception I had to wait until 2h30PM for my suite to be ready. No excuses, no upgrades. At 2h15, the front desk clerk reached me at the bar to tell me my suite was ready. That was a nice touch, but I was expecting my room to be ready when I arrived. Same story for checking out. I asked the front desk the day before my departure for a late checkout. They asked me what time, and when I said 6h00PM, they said it was impossible and the best they could do for me was 2h00PM. That\u2019s unacceptable from a hotel that clearly claims they have no check-in and checkout times.\nThe other negative is that I requested at the time of booking a high floor because I always like to have nice views when I book hotels. They gave me the 19th floor. I could say it is a high floor, but not in this case since their website says the hotel\u2019s one bedroom suites are located between 18th and 27th floor. \nThe third negative is the service in the room. For example, there was a lack in maid service. There were spots of dirt left after the daily maid service. Also, coffees and milks for the espresso machine were not refilled. So I had to call for a refill and it took more than half an hour to have someone come to my room even though they said someone was coming \u00abright now\u00bb. Same thing for the laundry service, the person at the phone said someone was already on her way to pick up my clothes but it took more than 15 minutes to have someone knock on my door. This same person asked me when I needed my clothes back and when I said for the next morning before 10h00AM, they replied \u00abno problems they will be in your room before 10\u00bb. They gave me back my clothes at 10h45AM without warning me they would arrive late.\nThese are some of the small details that, alone, are not that bad. But, put together, they leave a poor impression. It is unacceptable from a five star hotel who ask their clients more than 1300$/night to stay in the type of suite I had.\nNow, the positives.\nFirst, the in-room dining. Although expensive, everything from the presentation to the quality of the meal was perfect.\nWhen I needed transportation to go downtown, I asked if the chauffeured Maserati was available and it was. What an experience! The driver, I forgot his name, knows how to ride this sport car. He will get you to your destination in a very short time and don't be afraid, he is a very good driver.\nAlso, despite the erratic service I already mentioned above, the staff is, for the majority, exceptionally friendly. They will always smile, say hello and, when they remember, they will greet you by your name. \nConcerning the accommodation, the one-bedroom suite I had was very nice. It was nicely decorated and very spacious. These suites are equipped with washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, oven, etc. It really feels like you are at home. Also, the TV in the bathroom is a nice touch. \nIn conclusion, I would have given this hotel 3.5 stars. But since I can\u2019t give a half star, I give the Setai 4 stars because that\u2019s the number this hotel should have in reality. A 5 stars hotel is, in my opinion, close to perfection. Unfortunately, the Setai Fifth Avenue failed in many departments as stated above. It is still a very good hotel, but it costs too much for what you get in return.\nFor all these reasons, I do not think I will come back at this hotel. I\u2019m ready to pay a lot a money for service but I expect to get what I pay for which was not the case at the Setai. For the same price, next time I\u2019ll try the Trump International hotel or the Mandarin Oriental.", "author": {"username": "Thierry2488", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 15, "num_reviews": 10, "num_type_reviews": 6, "id": "11FC891BD59DDB16C738F1CF3D71E3AD", "location": "Montreal, Canada"}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 1776857, "num_helpful_votes": 2, "date": "October 27, 2012", "id": 143878689, "via_mobile": false}

The lobby area was quite large with a seating area/library off to one side and restaurant to the other. A few minutes later we were taken to our allocated room and shown all the amenities the room had to offer. Our room was on the 7th floor, (an XL King with view) and we had a lovely view of the library and 42nd Street. The bed was really comfortable, our son had a rollaway bed which was also comfortable. The bedroom was a good size and had a large 42inch flatscreen TV, sofa, mini fridge with complimentary snacks and non alcoholic drinks, safety deposit box, a small glass wardrobe, bedside drawers, iron & ironing board and desk with a telephone. There was a touchpad control for the lights and window blind, which was straight forward to use. It would have been handy if there was a mirror over the desk as the only other mirror in the room was next to the glass wardrobe in the entrance. It was mentioned in previous reviews about noise from the road outside, the only thing we could just about hear was the sound of police/fire engine sirens.\nThe bathroom was lovely, it had twin sinks, the shower area had a rain shower, normal shower and footbath. We managed to work out the controls for each one after a couple of goes. There was also a hairdryer and toiletries. The only thing I would suggest to change in the bathroom is the lighting, it was rather dim. Other than that the bathroom was very modern, clean and towels changed every day.\nBecause of hurricane Sandy the hotel issued us with a torch and glow sticks and offered us complimentary pay per view films/TV. We were expecting the power to fail, but fortunately the hotel was not affected (1 block away was in complete darkness)We were kept informed at all times by staff. When we were told our return flight was cancelled I contacted reception who extended our stay straight away and offered assistance contacting my airline. We met with other guests in the seating/library area of an evening, swapping stories over our glasses of complimentary wine (Ramone was the best 'host'). It is a nice touch that the hotel offers this between 6pm and 9pm each evening.\nWe used the restaurant for breakfast as everywhere else was closed due to Sandy. The eggs, bacon and hash brown was very nice and staff very attentive.\nThe Andaz 5th Ave is right in the middle of all the tourist areas, 5 mins in each direction to Grand Central Station, Time Square, Empire State Building and shopping on 5th Ave.\nThis was our 2nd trip to New York, 1st time at Andaz.

Another fun feature is that the room is operated entirely by touch, not traditional light switches.

We wanted to stay in an area that had a more local neighbourhood feeling so we thought the Upper West Side would do the trick. I was really impressed by the value of this hotel. With the tax we paid $344 a night for a King room. Other hotels I researched were even more then that and the pictures didn\u2019t seem as nice. We got there late at night and there was a big crowd in the lobby and low and behold Robin Williams was there visiting with fans. I assumed he was performing at the theatre next door but not sure. Seemed like a sign of a good visit. The room was very large. Much bigger then other New York hotels I\u2019ve stayed in. As well the d\u00e9cor was really nice and bed very comfortable. It definitely seemed like they had renovated recently. Before our arrival I emailed to request a quiet room on a higher floor. They gave us a room on the top floor which is 25th. Our room was across from the elevators which I thought might be a problem for noise but we barely heard anything from the hallway. As well I had read reviews about the elevators being slow but we never had an issues with them. We had chatted with some local residences of the hotel that had been living there for 25 years. It was interesting to stay in a place with such history. When we woke up our first morning we were stunned at the view. A great way to start everyday. \nThe subway is right around the corner which is really convenient. At the last minute I considered switching hotels to somewhere around Greenwich Village because I thought that we might be spending hours on the subway but the express train to Time Square is super fast. We would be downtown in around 15 minutes so getting around wasn\u2019t a problem at all. \nHaving the Viand Caf\u00e9 downstairs is really convenient as well. We arrived late at night and it was so nice to pop down for a snack and drink. On our last day we had to leave for our flight early so again it was nice to have a reasonably priced meal downstairs. We also had breakfast at Le Pain Quotiden on 72nd which we really enjoyed as well we went to Sarabeth\u2019s West which was good but nothing really special and pricey. We also partook in the famous Gray\u2019s Papaya for a snack too. A really nice wine store is just downstairs too and a Duane Reade closeby if you forgot any toiletries. \nThere\u2019s lots of shopping around the area too which we didn\u2019t expect which was great. A big DSW was just down the street. We rented bikes at Master Bike Shop on 72nd and did a nice ride around Central Park. \nFor the beautiful room, view, location, and value I\u2019d definitely recommend the Beacon.", "author": {"username": "unplainjane", "num_cities": 49, "num_helpful_votes": 111, "num_reviews": 68, "num_type_reviews": 51, "id": "1005ABAA83773778AB2A4BAAFE443901", "location": "toronto"}, "date_stayed": "November 2012", "offering_id": 93338, "num_helpful_votes": 3, "date": "November 14, 2012", "id": 145419124, "via_mobile": false}

It was quite clean and had good space, a nice sized closet, including a nook with a fridge for my own groceries as well as a mini bar. The bed was comfortable. A clock radio that will charge your iphone with plenty of plugs to recharge your electronics. I liked my room quite a bit. The front desk staff was kind and very helpful. They allowed me to check in early, and store my luggage on the day of departure. The doormen did a wonderful job helping with taxis and offering advice. However, they can not overcome everything.\nI had 2 significant problems during my stay. One was the noise in the hotel. Two was the lack of any civilized dining, as well as no room service at all.\nThe doors in the hotel slam. So between rowdy guests coming and going at all hours and the morning housekeeping staff hollering down the halls, sleeping at 10 pm or 8 am was just not possible. The walls are thin and I could hear the televisions of neighboring rooms. Believe me, I am accustomed to NYC noise and not much gets to me. The noise at the San Carlos was just overwhelming, not just annoying. I was there 5 nights, and guests cam and went, but the noise level did not change. Such a disappointment.\nHowever, the thing I hated more was the breakfast service in a cramped dark hot room. Breakfast, which was limited to bad bagels, toast, a couple of varieties of cereal and coffee was a chaotic mess. Tiny paper plates, cheap plastic knives that break, and tiny coffee cups that are too hot to carry was a horrible way to begin my day. Everything was disposable and unpleasant. Honestly, the airlines do better. I stayed there five days and not one morning could I easily grab a cup of coffee and take a seat. Just a mess. Don't even think about requesting a coffee service to be delivered to your room either. Other midtown hotels have self serve breakfast, and it works. The key is space, good variety, and enough staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and to provide assistance. Actual glassware, plates, and utensils would be nice. This just is the worst.\nThe San Carlos has the potential to be a good hotel. I wish I wanted to return. I wanted to like it very much.

We were very happy with our 'home' for 3 nights. The location was also easy access to Penn St Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macy's etc - easy walking distance to most sights but not as noisy an area as Times Square, etc.\nWe arrived pretty late on the first night so just went into the hotel bar for a quick drink and bar snack upon arrival. It has a nice ambience though the drinks were a little pricey (it is a hotel in Manhattan afterall!)\nThe hotel also does some nice touches for guests - inclusive continental breakfast which was very good - fresh juices, tea & coffee, wide choice of fresh fruits, pastries, cereals, breads, cheese & meats. You can choose hot buffet items for an additionsl 12 dollars or choose from the menu. We found the continental breakfast was plenty for us and breakfast is served in a light & airy conservatory.\nThey also provide free wine hour from 5pm-6pm, again very welcome after a long day sightseeing.\nWhen you need to check in online for your flights home, you can go to the business centre and use their PC to check in and print out your boarding card for free. That was a great, hassle-free service that meant we weren't waiting on busy staff to help us do this.\nWe signed up to the Kimpton InTouch membership before we visited - simply join online for free and you get perks such as free wifi and a voucher for free drinks from the minibar.\nI think I've previously read complaints about maids walking into the room when guests are still in there but that didn't happen with us. There isn't a 'do not disturb' sign to hang on the outside of the door; it's a light switch change next to the door. If the room is empty then the light is orange; if you don't want to be disturbed then flick the switch and it changes to red, telling the maids not to enter.

I was really excited about staying at this five star hotel that has received many great reviews. Our last stay was at Sofitel, and I absolutely loved the service (held your bags, doorman became my friend, gorgeous suite)- Sofitel clearly understands five-star service. The Setai, in my standards, could not deliver when it came to friendly service and hospitality. The concierage did not go out of their way, and the doormen acted more like security guards. The only employee in Setai that actually knew the meaning of real quality five-star service was Brett. Thank you, Brett :) The rest should learn from him!\nHere is a breakdown of the Positives and Negatives:\n- gave us a room right away as soon as we landed, so easy early check in\n- became obsessed with the espresso machine! But, housekeeper was so cheap on providing extra pods\n- good location if you are into midtown/Times Square, personally, next time we want to be closer to Central Park \n- Gym had good equipment, but dark paint on walls and no windows may be a hard environment for some to work out in, and what's up with the old, bruised fruit?\n- the room service was nice and quick (Sheniqua was a friendly voice on the other end)\n- free shoe shine and ironing\n- even though I was not happy with the hotel, the room itself was great. Our deluxe king room and bathroom was spacious and nice\n- mini-fridge\n- hotel car, if you can get it, is a maserati\n- be careful, since the location is right on fifth ave, lower level room occupants might be able to hear the busy street, we were on floor 15, but I could still hear the hustle and bustle outside from the bathroom only not the room\n******* Oh, the icing on the cake, the housekeeper threw away my take-out twice! The first time, grrr, I let it go, but then the next day, my Mario Batali pizza that was not even placed near a garbage was also \"cleaned up\".

The Setai is the first one that hits on that metric.\nFirst off, the location is convenient to both Penn and Grand Central Stations, being only a few blocks walk from each. Close to the E Subway (from JFK) as well. SO far, so good.\nRoom was huge, and well stocked with water, sodas and Nespresso, all of which are included. It's not cheap by any means, but in NY nothing is, and the hotels we have tried in the $250-$350 range have generally been old, run down places with noisy (and largely non-functional) HVAC. The air system in the room at the Setai got a good amount of chill into the room, and did so quietly. Bravo!\nTraffic noise was very muted, with is saying something for NY, the city that never sleeps and never stops blowing the horn on the taxi. The only noise issue was that the doors do not have any kind of damper on the closing/hinge, so if the guest doesn't bother to close the door gently, it slams. That was not an issue on Thursday or Friday of our stay, but Saturday apparently some of the guests on the floor partied late (3-4 am) and then came back too inebriated to bother keeping the noise level down. That interrupted sleep numerous times because of the banging of the doors. Management please take note. Put door closers on the guest rooms, so that the door will close gently and quietly.\nFood was expensive but good. Fortunately, my wife is a member of the Leading Hotels program, so we got a $70 breakfast credit daily. That sounds like a lot, but it is about what breakfast for two costs.

I moved out of NY a year ago, and miss it terribly. I wanted to be right back where I used to live. I was a little hesitant about the Beacon, because I had been in there years ago. And I mean over 20 years ago, and it wasn't very nice. But it has REALLY changed!!! It's VERY nice!!! Let me break it down from the big picture to the small details.\nLocation: Perfect for me. I love the Upper West Side. I spend most of my time in Central Park (walking, photographing, running, bird watching, people watching, going to the zoo, bike riding, exploring, etc). My goal when I lived in NY was to live as close to Fairway (a unique grocery store) as humanly possible. The Beacon is right across the street. And the Beacon has kitchens in each room, so I actually did buy food at Fairway and prepared it in my room. But back to the location description. 75th and Broadway is the epicenter of 3 amazing cupcake shops, a famous bakery, Fairway, Zabars, Juice Generation (great smoohties), Harry's Burritos, Big Nicks, Shake Shack, the Park, three excellent gyms and a couple great yoga places. If your vacation plans don't revolve around food and exercise, you'll think that list was strange. But for me, it was perfect. It was like being home. I should also mention Lincoln Center and the Natural History museum are very close by. All the museums on the East Side are walkable through the park. If you're more into the downtown scene/night life or Broadway, maybe it's not for you. But hey, the subway is RIGHT THERE, so transportation is convenient.\nHotel: The lobby, staff, elevators were all superior for a non-brand hotel.\nHallways: Carpeted, fairly quiet, wide and clean.\nRooms. Bright, clean, newly remodeled, spacious, welcoming, pleasing finishes, comfortable. Each room (as far as I know) has a kitchen (with dishes/pots and pans),a safe, tv, free wifi, extra blankets, good toiletries, ironing board, luggage rack, comfortable beds and pillows. Our room was amazing. It was room 2112, on the 21st floor. It was a corner room with a view I could NOT keep my eyes off of. One window faced Central Park and the East side. One faced downtown. We had views of Times Square, The Chrysler Building, Broadway (the street) and the Ansonia-which is a gorgeous building, and on the East, views of some of my very favorite architecture (the San Remo!), Citicorp, the Sherry Netherland and that glorious Park. We slept with the blinds open. We watched the sun rise over the buildings, We couldn't stop looking or taking pictures. I had lived in NY 10 years, in many apartments, and I never had a view like that. \nBTW there were also windows in the kitchen and Bathroom.The one in the bathroom opened.\nI will ALWAYS stay at this hotel when I'm in NY.

The valet staff were very prompt and friendly, so I do want to give special thanks to them because they made a wonderful first impression. \nThe lobby is nice. There is something very retro about the chandeliers, but it somehow works. Overall, I would say the lobby is quite impressive and in line with the purported star rating of the hotel. The exterior, however, is very very 70's. There is absolutely nothing they can do about that, but you cannot help but notice it.\nThe desk clerk was quite pleasant. I cannot remember her name, but as with most people at the hotel, if you were interacting with them in person, they delivered top-notch service. My biggest complaint about the service, and it is a big one, is that they NEVER answer the phone promptly. I literally would let the phone ring 30+ times, still with no answer. So then I would try housekeeping, the concierge, room service, anybody...same thing. For a five-star hotel, it is pretty unacceptable for this to occur. One time - sure; things happen. This problem, however, existed throughout my entire stay. \nAs others have noted, there are certain elements that make the hotel appear quite dated. The elevators are ancient and should definitely be at the top of the list for upcoming renovations. The tracks on the drapes in the room were also quite old. The rooms were pleasant, but not extraordinary. I had to switch rooms, however, because the first one had a very awful musty smell. We were then moved to a room on the level with the pool. It was okay, but it felt very dark. Also, the pool area looked a bit worse for wear. I can imagine how luxurious this place must have been in its prime, but that prime has certainly passed. \nOne thing that I find absolutely unforgiveable about this hotel, though, is the ice machine room. They need to remove all signage relating to the ice machine and make guests call to have ice delivered. I had the misfortune of going to fetch my own ice, and I walked into a room that was filthy, covered in trash and clearly (hopefully) not meant to be seen by guests. I was so shocked. For any hotel above 1 star, I would expect more.\nThe location is great, and you are able to get out of the city quickly, but I was surprised at how dead Houston is at night. Clearly, this has nothing to do with the hotel, so I am not trying to make any connection there; I was just surprised. I would think it might be wiser to stay near the Galleria if you are looking for something other than just a business stay.\nAll in all, the stay was \"ok\"; nothing really wow'ed me about this place, so I guess that disappoints me, but I tend to find that to be the case with Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton properties.

Thoughts :\n-great location. On W44th between 5th and 6th, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a few mins walk from Times Square, but W44th is not the noisiest street so good from that perspective\n-boutique feel. It's small in NYC hotel terms, and perhaps lacks some of the facilities as a result, but is also friendlier than many. Staff are great.\n-the room I had was inward facing and had no view at all (a wall obscured part of the window - could not even tell what the weather was like - seriously). However, this also meant the room was quiet - not always the case in NYC\n-room was pretty small. Was fine for me travelling solo but would've been cramped if shared. I don't know if this was typical of rooms in the hotel but I suspect it was\n-room was otherwise v nice. Quality fittings, nice linen, new-looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries, with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room\n-wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC - could save you $20/day\n-room service menu is very limited, although food (from Triomphe, the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered.

{"ratings": {"overall": 4.0}, "title": "\u201cGreat location, would stay again, but...\u201d", "text": "Just finished a long weekend stay at the Andaz. Prefer to stay at Hyatts for reward status, and now have stayed in all Of the Hyatts in Manhattan. Observations:\n1) Check-in was a mess. The Andaz philosophy of iPads around a central desk area without a formal checkin desk can be hectic when busy, but there wasn't any line. Stood for a minute with no assistance, eventually an associate looked up from computer screen to see us, but then helped a guest who had a question, who showed up at desk after we arrived. Associate who checked us in informed us our room wasn't ready, acknowledged our Gold Passport status, took our cell phone #, took our bags. Was told at checkin something about 'I'm checking to see what the best room we have available is', and then told quickly before whisking our bags away that 'we have a King room available for you'- same category booked. If no upgrades available, I understand, but don't treat the category booked as a favor. \n2) No perfect location in Manhattan as you may prefer both uptown and downtown locations, but hotel is almost in perfect spot. Easy access to Grand Central and 4/5/6 line uptown or downtown, easy walking distance to all midtown locations. Difficult to get a taxi during weekday business hours, there is no dedicated cab stand for hotel. Saw our associate outside the hotel when returning from unsuccessfully trying to hail a cab on 5th Ave, he offered to wait on 5th to hail a taxi, we laughed and said that wouldn't be necessary.\n3) Received ph call that room was ready about 10min after checkin. Room was right across elevator-- normally not a fan of this at all but hotel was very quiet during stay, no noise issues. \n4) Room is spartan, no wall ornaments/pictures but I don't mind this, not staying for artwork. Large desk with plenty of outlets, one large outside window with automated blind coverage, large cream couch for lounging/clothes, comfy bed. Plenty of room for luggage.\n5) Fridge well stocked, I suspect most adults won't drink the fruit soda, there is room in the fridge for your own beverages if you move things around/out. The food is a bag of pretty good potato chips, two ok chocolate squares, and an incredibly salty granola bar.\n6) TV has a lot of interactive/smart features but only a smattering of HD channels, not an issue for me but if you are watching a lot of TV in your room it is a bit puzzling.\n7) Bathroom is poorly designed. Two sinks, plenty of space, but two extremely bad design choices. First, no door separating toilet from rest of bathroom. I am not a fan of modern/Mandarin Oriental-like open or exposed bathroom spaces, and not having a separate WC is really not negotiable, esp for those guests sharing a room who aren't involved. Second, the shower stall is really poorly designed. The glass partition, like in lots of European hotels, doesn't extend far enough to stop splashing into the rest of the bathroom. The shower is a rainshower head with high ceilings, I'm not that tall or large but there is no way to stop water from splashing over and on to the small ledge separating the stall from the rest of the bathroom floor, you have to wipe the ledge mult times during the shower to control the water from spreading. In addition the corner between the glass partition and the back wall of the shower has at least a 1/3 inch gap between them, so water splashes through that gap and in the corner behind the sinks. More wiping down, and that area has already started to have discoloration and wear of the tile and grout. It's inconvenient, and adds to maintenance costs, and will eventually require renovation before it was necessary. Hyatt must spend millions on new room prototypes- I don't understand how this wasn't recognized as a problem. The Andaz Wall Street has similar shower sizes but not the same problems.\n8) Good coffee service in the lobby. Some fruit in baskets but no other snackies. Good selection of papers.\n9) Didn't go to gym or spa. No room service ordered.\n10) Went to restaurant for Sunday breakfast. Priced similarly to other hotel restaurants. Crowded, had a wait for a table. Breakfast was excellent, recommend the mini brats.\nProb the first choice for Hyatts in Manhattan because of location. I think the Andaz Wall Street has nicer rooms, service, restaurant, 48 Lex comparable in quality for usually less money. Will see what the anticipated Park Hyatt brings. Overall would stay again.\nContact me for any questions.

It has a Cafe. I had been at this same hotel last year and frankly, the service was terrible. I and my friend waited 20 minutes for a waiter to come around..completely mind blowing. Especially for a Hilton. This year, I'm pleasantly surprised. The crew of the Cafe, beginning with Juan A. Gererro, Cafe supervisor, Yulia Putnam, Beverage and Food, from St. Petersburg, Russia and our incredible waiter, Yorbel, from Kazakhstan, turned this situation around. What a lovely shock! I love Hilton's because they truly are a UN, bringing people from all parts of the world together. Yorbel was a treasure. He is intelligent, personable, a really good hearted person. Yorbel is in his\n3rd year of accounting at the University here in Houston. Further, he's already passed his first CPA of three. He's one of those people who is going to go FAR in life, be very successful. He's a waiter at the Cafe and what ashamed...his talents are so much more. I hope Hilton will consider him for a position in Accounting and utilize all of him, instead of a tiny part of him. Needless to say, we came back for lunch nearly every day and were given swift, prompt service with a genuine and sincere smile. Honestly, it felt like a family was welcoming us. And that's why I'm taking the time to put this on TripAdvisor. It was an incredible experience. Beyond the norm. The Hilton management has really chosen fine people in a service industry that sometimes falls very short. The food quality was never a question. It is excellent, served hot and is creative. Our favorites were the Tortilla soup, the crab cakes and the quesadilla. Dinners were always hot and delicious. My particular favorite was a caesar salad with slices of flatiron steak on it. We had room service, which has always been speedy--20 minutes after the phone call. The food arrived hot. I'll be coming back to the Hilton Americas next fall for the IQA, international Quilt Association, show. And I'm really looking forward to eating in the Cafe again, instead of dreading it as I did in 2011. Thank you, Juan, Julia and Yorbel.

When we woke up the first morning, it was fantastic to open the blinds to see New York city in all its urban glory. It was really exciting and we could not wait to get going. As soon as you step out, you are right in the centre of everything you came to New York for.\nWe understand the beds are new since a year and we slept like babies which was fantastic because we suffered no jet lag (from UK) and I was found I was sleeping for 10 hours! (unheard of). Not only are the windows sound proofed but the hotel is in a quiet zone where traffic must resist honking and beeping at certain times of the night. For the 4 nights we were guests, we did not hear a single sound from the corridors either last thing at night or early morning which is highly unusual. Probably the best sleep I have had overseas.\nWe had a kitchenette which is ok - one can knock up a bit of breakfast but nothing too complicated. There is no worktop space and about 3 cooking utensils with enough cutlery for 2 people. The fridge is great for fruit, eggs and juice. A coffee machine is provided and a kettle.\nEverything worked like clockwork. The only comment would be that I missed having a bar, a communal area to fall into after a long day's walking the great streets and sights of Manhatten. Loved to have come back for a cocktail and communal chat with other residents, etc. \nThe hotel is billed as a 3 star but we can categorically say the bedrooms are 4 star.

The infinity pool on the 18th floor was nice but we didn't try it out due to the rainy weather and LOTS of people. The view is very nice! The pool is heated so it could be used most of the year. The section of the 18th floor where the pool is located is covered but open on the sides to the elements. The 24 Grille, located in the lobby is a little expensive but comparable to other hotels. I recommend the Orange Blueberry Pancakes for breakfast. Yum! This Westin provides a free shuttle to nearby businesses and restaurants. They do charge for parking so the free shuttle is the way to go. CityCentre is about 15 minutes away and a great place to meet friends, shop and eat out.

The manager took care of this issue, as we were clearly un-happy with this. The following morning's breakfast was very week....at best.

Prices were jacked up by $50 a night after the storm (supposedly because of the Marathon). The TV system throughout the hotel was brushed off and our problems were only addressed when we pointed out that we were not 1 or two night guests but in fact there for weeks.

We had a very comfortable and spacious room on the 25th floor, with a small kitchenette, fridge etc useful for preparing breakfast. There is no restaurant or bar at this hotel but there are plenty of both within a short walking distance. We can recommend Viand next door to the hotel for breakfast and 'Citrus', an excellent Thai restaurant just round the corner (great sushi). There is a huge Fairway supermarket across the road and an amazing (if expensive) delicatessan next door to that. Central Park is 2 blocks away, it takes about 20 minutes walking briskly.

With so many choices, it should be easy to find a myriad of properties that suit any number of requirements. But for me, it was a struggle to find the perfect location, level of amenities, and acceptable price point for a recent 4-day trip w/ my hubby.\u00a0\nI ruled out the overpriced hipster boutiques, the stuffy landmarks, the dinosaur properties, the tourist-laden chains, and the too-good-to-be true rates in less desirable parts of town. After that, I wasn't left with nearly as many options as you'd think.\nThen I found the listing for the San Carlos. I loved that they're one of the very last independently owned hotels in NYC, catered to a European clientele (which usually means non-fussy rooms, immaculately clean spaces, and competent staff), and the Manhattan East location; the area was convenient to RCMH where we were seeing 2 nights of concerts. The fact the rooms looked large vs the price and came w/ mini fridges and microwaves (somewhat unusual for Manhattan) sealed the deal. But looking good on paper doesn't mean in reality it will pan out.\nI'd made my reservation months in advance, over the phone, for a certain room type that the young lady I spoke to had 100% guaranteed. When I called week-of to confirm my reservation, I was told there was a possibility I might not be able to get the room type I'd been promised. Irked, I referenced the original reservation but they explained sometimes these things happen. True, but I hung up the phone and considered rebooking elsewhere; the phone rang back moments later and the young lady I originally spoke to apologized, said they would upgrade me at no fee and get me what I needed no matter what, and really acted as if she valued my business. I'd expect this from a 5 star property, but at a under $300 a night spot, it was refreshing. Customer service is a dying art. The staff at the San Carlos is old school, in the best possible, most refreshing way.\u00a0\nUpon arrival, an easy cab ride from Penn Station, the lobby was sparkling, the bellman exceptional, and the check-in flawless. It's not the fanciest place, more suited for the upscale business traveler (though I spied many families too) but the cleanliness, a huge factor for me, absolutely perfect. And my room, a King, was HUGE. Not huge just by NYC standards, huge by any hotel standard.\u00a0\nThe view from our particular room wasn't much to see, but windows that actually open in both the room and bathroom were a bonus. The amenities were lovely, towels and robe divinely soft, the bed linens super comfy, and a pant press a blast from the past. The room was modern, simple, understated, private, quiet, and cozy. Everything worked too. Which should go without saying but unfortunately is often not the case in any class of hotel. The real silverware, plates, and glasses provided were a great compliment to the microwave and fridge.\n\u00a0Did I mention that housekeeping is outstanding? In my years of travel, I've never seen more competent housecleaning.\u00a0\nMy interaction with the staff was easy peasy. Items I needed were sent up immediately, dinner spots/phone numbers provided, and I was always greeted with a smile. I dreaded check out because it meant our experience was over. I literally had zero complaints during my entire stay except that the Indian restaurant next door (that serves as the San Carlos' complimentary breakfast serving area and then offers their own menu for limited room service too), is simply not up to par with the rest of the hotel. \u00a0If 24 hour American cuisine room service is a make it or break it deal for you, that's about the only reason I'd consider finding a different hotel. Seeing as Manhattan has every food conceivable, most of it deliverable, I easily overlook this.\nQuiet rooms, pleasant interiors/halls, a great business center/overflow lobby, elevators that were kept constantly cleaned (check the Ritz for smudges, lol), and staff that valued my business means that next I'm in NYC I'm making a beeline right back here. Sure, there's more glamorous or hip spots, but for the level of service vs price and comfort, there's a reason this is a hidden gem amongst your hundreds of NYC hotels.

The few times I decided to walk to the downtown, a 15-minutes walk took me to the heart of it.

Our only problem was the horrible room service experience on the day of our departure. They messed up our order not just once, but twice and it was still not correct! We had ordered two steaks-medium rare with broccoli and a toffee cake dessert with ice cream. The 1st time they forgot the broccoli, cooked our steakes well, and brought us up a plate of toffee cake with the ice cream completely melted! Shame to even try serving a guest a dessert that looked like that! The server apologized and said the kitchen was too hot, but that is no excuse! The second time it took over an hour to get our meal. This time they seperated the ice cream and cake which was great, remembered the broccoli, but our steaks were still well! By then we were so hungry and had no time (or nerve) to request a re-make. The kitchen took care of our meal but we were still highly dissatisfied. We complained to the front office manager, Mrs. Heinrichs, who was very nice and did say they were short staffed (one person was shuttling and delivering room service simultaneously?) but they should have gotten another attendant or someone from the restaurant to help.

This hotel is perfect if you are are going on holidays to Manhattan with a family.\nWe were on a family trip of a lifetime to New York for a few days and this hotel made it the perfect holiday.

The kitchen had a normal (by Irish standards) sized fridge and cooker plus a microwave. It was just an alcove really but perfectly adequate for preparing / heating up the goodies from Fairways.\nThere was a laundry across the hall from us which also had two payphones - so we could use prepaid phone cards to call home very cheaply. Tea and coffee were provided. The coffee perculator was intuitive to use and made exceptionally nice coffee.\nFairways supermarket is directly across the road. It is not for the faint hearted as it is a warren, and very busy. At the meat and deli counters you need to take a ticket and wait for your number to be roared out (took me a while to figure this out!)That said, it is a tourist attraction in its own right for those more used to pushing a trolly around Tescos or Lidl. Just don't take kids when you are doing that first supplies shop especially if they are just off the plane and tired. We remained pretty much on Irish time while in New York as it was only for a few days so meals from Fairways at the dining table in our room was ideal rather than restaurants with children.\nThe subway is left out of the hotel and two minute walk. There is a self service machine on the way in. We put $20 on a metrocard which allowed the four of us to be swiped through one after the other. You can see your balance at the turnstyle as you swipe. Just be sure you know your uptown from your downtown before you travel. The subway stops at convenient points for all tourist attractions.\nCentral Park is two blocks away and a haven to come back to in the afternoon after sighseeing.

And speaking of warmth, I had to call my \"personal assistant\" for several blankets because my room was so very cold. With the temperature set way above \n70, I could not get the room over 68. Why would a hotel of this caliber not have a true concierge staff headed up by a member of the clefs d'or? I called prior to arrival to ask about theatre tickets and the personal assistant had no idea what show (on Broadway) that I was speaking about. First thing she asked me was had I gone online to Telecharge to look for tickets. Huh? During my first day at the hotel I again called my assistant for dinner reservations within the hotel. This time I was told to call the restaurant directly. I guess I am unclear as to what the staff is there for. They are nice young people, but woefully undertrained. First evening I asked the doorman for a taxi. He never greeted me or made eye contact. He seemed preoccupied with the headsets that he was wearing and asked me several times where I was going. \nOn the plus side, front desk staff was very pleasant and room service and housekeeping could not have been nicer.

In the event I very nearly cancelled due to the awful effect of Hurricane Sandy and the uncertainty of what we would find, but the hotel gave me assurances by telephone that they were almost functioning at 100%. We were so pleased that we went ahead. The staff in the hotel were very pleasant and friendly -- and genuine, not 'have a nice day' whoever you are style. We had some very interesting chats and they had some stories to tell of the impact of the storm on themselves and friends --- but all were very positive and there was also a nice friendly atmosphere among guests who included forlorn marathon runners and some refugees and their dogs. The hotel is tremendously relaxed. We were in an incredible 20th floor room overlooking both 6th Avenue and 29th Street. Just lovely and comfortable. The bed was one of the best ever. It was certainly more spacious than other hotel rooms in big cities that we've been in. We became regulars at the evening Wine Reception and studiously managed three glasses each and also availed of the tea/coffee at reception each morning; though we did miss not having tea or coffee in the room which is after all the norm in UK hotels. Not wanting to deviate from our affection for this hotel, we do want to mention a few other aspects that may be worth consideration by the management: having to pay premium prices for drinking water in the bedroom seemed just a little mean; we didn't really enjoy the breakfast - eggs were quite runny with a strange tang and the sitting area was cold; the hairdryer had a very short cable and there was nowhere in the room really suitable to use it with a mirror; while there were dressing gowns, there were no slippers -- thick socks which served as slippers were hanging in the cupboard and could be purchased, but it's just that any hotel we have been in with robes have also had basic slippers. Oh and by the way we had a brilliant time in New York - we adored the New Yorkers who are for sure among the friendliest, warmest and most genuine people in the world.

We were very happy to have chosen this hotel! It has an elegance not expected for a hotel in NYC for this price! It was super duper trendy, and the rooms have amazing bathrooms, and lots of space and great views!!! (Our view in particular was that of the Empire State Building!).

The bar area, and restaurant are situated on the backside of the hotel, and through the back part of the bar restaurant, you look out through a glass wall of windows onto their xtra big screen hanging on the side of another building across the street! Super cool! The wine hour with appetizers daily is something you will not find in NYC period! The staff was always willing to help with recommendations, even though we are the type of people that research in the weeks prior to our trip where to go and what to do, have no fear, being a fly by the seat of your pants type of guest is perfect in this hotel! They make recs fitting to your interest, and make reservations for you, etc. They take care of it all! Since we celebrated our anniversary there in Oct during our stay, they had a bottle of wine and a fruit tray sent to our room the day we checked in! Sweet! Some have mentioned that they don't like this part of town...because it is just shy south of the hub-bub of times square, but I found that great!!

The people make the place, thus the title of my review.\nI have spent over 60 nights this year at this hotel and consider it the very best hotel I have every been at. I say this from several perspectives (starting with the staff, above). The ground floor is stunning. The massive open area is very impressive and compares well with all but the most exclusive 5-star hotels. It is truly world class. \nThis is a convention hotel and when it is busy there are people milling about everywhere. This can be a form of entertainment in itself. There are places one can go to escape all the noise and commotion when one needs some quiet time so don't feel intimidated by this aspect.\nThe breakfast is amazing. The food is gourmet quality. The fruits are freshiest and tastiest I've had. Even something as simple as scrambled eggs is a real treat. Don't miss it. It is well worth the price.\nThe location is great. It is next to convention, baseball, and basketball/concert venues. One can walk to most downtown places, but a cab is immediately available at the whistle of the bell captain. The LRT is within an easy walk, and it goes all the way to Reliant Stadium.\nThis hotel is not cheap, but you get what you pay for (world class) - the best staff in the business, gourmet food, some great rooms with great views, tranportation on demand, and a home away from home.", "author": {"username": "Gary S", "num_reviews": 1, "id": "9B34E14B6B3E193835D7F0DDE6D06CE0", "location": "Industry, Pennsylvania", "num_helpful_votes": 1}, "date_stayed": "October 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "October 20, 2012", "id": 143298050, "via_mobile": false}

I was sick and I called the front desk SEVERAL times to tell them not to cancel my reservation which was GUARANTEED with a CC because I would be there by 6 a.m. Monday morning instead of Sunday night. The reservation WAS cancelled and the hotel was booked for the entire length of my conference - no apologies at the time. I wrote a letter and finally got a \"free romance weekend night\" apology. That night was last Friday 8.1.08. First of all, we were given the \"murder central\" room at the end of the hall by the stairwell where the noise transfers extensively. The only time I have been given this room in the past is when I get a \"priceline room\" or the \"military rate\" room. Our romantic strawberries were great. And then, it started - the noise. About 9 p.m. we could hear very loud laughter. We waited to see if it would quit on it's own - I AM NOT A COMPLAINER! really. We complained about the noise twice before 11 p.m. - no apologies or offer to move us to a quieter room. I was awake listening to DOORS SLAM! loud laughter, someone singing in the shower near me, and music. I finally called the front desk around 4 a.m. They said there was nothing they could do and offered to move us. WE LEFT - sleeping in my bed at home with my three dogs and cat was is more romantic! The entire hotel management and especially the front desk manager Michele K. does not have a good handle on the staff or the quality of service. The rooms ARE dated - looks like something Lucy and Dezi would have stayed in on one of their trips to California... Room Service is limited.

Flashed the room key and in we went. \nAll went well during our four night stay until our departure, on checking the bill it had been charged to the wrong card I was assured it would be changed, got back to the UK to find the bill had been charged to my card in error, which has just been refunded to my card after eleven days, after many phone calls and emails to the hotel and visa, I am still awaiting a part refund for the difference in the exchange rates that the banks had the nerve to charge me,which amounts to a couple of hundred dollars, if the total had been a couple of hundred dollars I would not have pursued it as much but as it was $4000 it needed dealing with asap, an awful lot of work for something which should never have happened as I felt I had dealt with this before my departure on the 24th sept, everyone was very apologetic about the issue but I really could have done without all this hassle, Thanks for the stay Setai it was great except for the issue and work on my return home.\nPS.

Listing the positives first, the hotel is admittedly a beautifully decorated well thought out property and the head butler Brandon was fantastic. Unfortunately, I left the hotel utterly disappointed and completely enraged by the front desk staff and management.\nWhen booking a junior suite two months out, I requested one with a terrace and asked for an early check-in depending on availability. Two weeks out I called to reconfirm the request and when the hotel called me two days out I repeated it for a third time. During check-in, my request was once again relayed, though unfortunately a terrace suite wasn't available that day nor could I check in early... no big deal. However, I was told I could move rooms the following day to have the terrace to which I agreed to.\nLater that day when our room was ready (received no phone call btw even though we were informed we would be called), it was once again communicated we would like to move the next day. The next day when I called in the front desk staff had no idea what I was talking about, but were looking into it. I called back 20 minutes later when we had to leave for a tour and were told they didn't have an answer yet, but the manager would call. Once again, no phone call was received. \nUpon return to the hotel, I was told they were very sorry, but room wasn't available. Of course we had not unpacked due to the promised room transfer and was quite frustrated at the huge lack of communication especially by such an expensive/highly rated hotel. Unfortunately, I did not have time to continue the discussion as we needed to change and head to a show, but informed the manager I expected him to do something to write their wrong of over promising, not communicating between staff members and not ever calling/following up with me. Once again, a phone call was promised and never received.\nThat night upon return was my bubbling point as there was a new and very rude girl working the desk who told me essentially all I was saying was a lie and no request for a room was every made, meaning no phone calls before arriving, no communication upon check in, etc. I proceeded to go off on her and her manager who finally realized they were wrong and apologized. But guess what... nothing was ever done by them.\nBeing in the customer service business you need to control your clients expectations and if they have simply told me the room wasn't available upon check in then no big deal. Instead they caused a huge ordeal as they lacked any resemblance of customer service or professionalism. I would never ever recommend this hotel and the frustration/stress their front desk caused essentially ruined me and my girlfriend's trip to NYC.", "author": {"username": "NBMatthew", "num_cities": 5, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 10, "location": "Newport Beach, California", "id": "350BD4E529DC955C8C319D13E7507013"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 6, "date": "September 10, 2012", "id": 139938229, "via_mobile": false}

We have been to New York a few times and this was by far the best location we have stayed at. An easy taxi or walk to all locations and perfect for getting about.\nWe stayed in a King Deluxe City View which was great. We were meant to upgrade to a Suite but the room was so nice that we decided to avoid the hassle and requested to remain in the room. This is where my minor issue occurred. On check out the bill for the 2 night adjustment was huge...we also hadn't been told it would be assuming (probably wrongly) that the rate would remain the same as we had been paying. On the day the manager did try to help and reduce things a bit but I subsequently contacted them on my return and they were able to reduce things fully for us. It was wrong not to say the rate would change when we said we would stay but the way it was handled was superb and I would not hesitate to stay again.\nBack to the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The views were great and the service in the room (both room service and cleaning) was good. The lifts were a bit slow but we were there at the same time as a large French party who all seemed to leave at the same time. Certainly nothing to moan about as it was all good fun cramming into the lift!\nWhat I do want to highlight above anything else is the fantastic and personalised service provided by one member of the front of house, Kevin Rountree. The trip to NY was planned so that I could propose to my girlfriend. Living in Hong Kong the logistics of doing this were tricky so I contacted the front desk a few weeks before to see if someone could help. That someone was Kevin who helped arrange EVERYTHING and most of it in his free time. He was even at the proposal location (a bookshop recommended by him) to set everything up on his morning off. Honestly cannot think of anywhere that has given such a personalised service and whilst we may have got lucky with Kevin specifically we could sense that the overall vibe was that people were there to help. Kevin though we have to thank you again and hope someone gives you a promotion for your efforts!\nWe would stay and perhaps even plan to do so again in 2013.

Seriously - it was like he was in the room with us. We determined that the vent was to blame. We mentioned it to the front desk, their response: \"We're very sorry\"\n6. Cold water.

When I also manage to get the same exceptional service and attention as those who can easily afford such luxury, it's a very rare combination indeed. But the Sherry hit a home run on both counts and I think that I've found my special go-to place to stay. From the youngest to the oldest employee, from the early morning/late night front desk staff to every single elevator captain and bellop, ALL were unfailingly polite and cheerful! You really get the sense that they love their jobs and they are super happy to serve. Each time my mother and I came through the door, I felt as though we were truly welcomed \"home\". In fact, it got to be nothing to just hang out in the lobby and get the best tips on where to shop or get the best coffee and brunch. I am serious...this staff can give the top hotels in NYC some lessons in true hospitality.\nRoom 211, which I think was a wonderful upgrade on their part, is fit for any special occasion. Spacious, beautifully appointed with a big screen TV and a gazillion cable stations, a wonderful large bathroom, lots of light , and a birds-eye view of the CBS Early Show studio....not to mention a corner of the famous corner anchored by The Plaza Hotel. There were times when we just felt like \"staying put\", but we didn't miss out on the buzz of the city. It was right outside to see!\nWant to get away quick? The subway stop is right around the corner of the hotel. You can be in Union Square (HUGE Filene's and Whole Foods Market) in less than 25-minutes. Feel like you need to commit to an East Side -vs-West Side experience? Don't bother. You can do both without much effort with cabs and cross-town buses all around -- not to mention horse drawn carriages. An escape to the more magical? Famous Central Park, which can seem postively other-worldly in the quiet morning sunlight, is steps aways.\nWhen in NYC, we usually stay at The Casablanca, The Elysee, and The Lucerne. Each has a lot to recommend it. But I honestly have to say that I am going to take time to check out the Sherry first before I look elsewhere from now on.

The first two days, no one bothered me when the Do Not Disturb sign was up, and when I left the room around 11am on those days, I called Housekeeping and told them my room was available to clean. The third day, at around 10:30am, Housekeeping CALLED ME, saying the Do Not Disturb sign was up, did I want any towels? I would expect that in a cheap motel, but the prices here do not reflect a cheap motel. When I complained, instead of apologizing, the staff made excuses. There is no excuse for calling a room when the Do Not Disturb sign is up. There are nicer hotels for this price.

Let me tell you that a few days was just not enough. I wish I could have stayed longer! \nPeter, the doorman, greeted us and right away I knew there was something special about this NYC hotel: THE PERSONAL TOUCH that is just lacking in some bigger hotels. Yes, the Chatwal is a smaller hotel, but the secret to its success is that it has a BIG heart. This is very evident in their staff. I have traveled all over and have never received such service from a wonderfully friendly, well-trained, professional staff. Brandon, head butler, came to our room to check on us personally and to see that we had everything we needed. Tall, stately, and with classic white gloves, he certainly represented the hotel well.\nI talked mostly to two people at the front desk, Lance and Elizabeth, who were polished, knowledgeable, and again, very friendly. When I called for assistance, I think I always talked to them, too.\nAs to location, The Chatwal has a prime location, just a few blocks away from Times Square, and we were able to walk nearly everywhere we wished to go.\nI took full advantage of our fabulous concierge, Nick, who was even able to get us tickets to \u201cPhantom,\u201d with very short notice. He also booked our tea time at the Palm Court and gave us some very good advice as to where to shop and sight see. He handed us directions that we could take with us, which we greatly appreciated.\nOur suite was what I would call \u201cmodern classic,\u201d and I would define that as, extremely comfortable, but very high tech. I don\u2019t think I ever did figure out all the buttons on the toilet and the heated seat would actually spoil you. The TV in the bathroom is an interesting touch. The shower\u2026okay, I\u2019d like to live in the shower. It had a huge rain shower head and it the entire bathroom was done in black marble with silver chips that made you think of the moon against a dark sky. We also appreciated the Internet connection and wireless service.\nWhen you stay at the Chatwal, don\u2019t forget to book something in the spa, which is on the lower level. I had a pedicure and Lupe was just a joy to chat with\u2026and she did a great job on my feet and toes!\nWe had a delicious breakfast one morning. Do NOT pass up the pastries. You can go back on your diet when you get home! The almond croissants and pain au chocolat were better than some I have gotten in fabled French restaurants. We had dinner one night there and I just had to ask who the chef was, since it was such a delightful meal. I was told that the chef is Jeffrey Zacharian and you may have seen him on Iron Chef, as a winner. I was also told that he is going to do a show for the Food Channel in the future. That should be interesting.\nOur savior was the Chatwal\u2019s Assistant Manager, George Petkovic. I think this man can be everywhere at once! His energy is boundless. He called us the morning we were scheduled to leave the hotel to inform us that our flight reservations had been cancelled for that evening. The airline had not given him a reason for the cancellation, but within 15 minutes he had gotten us alternative reservations. Since we had to leave a bit earlier than we planned, George had also booked a car for us. After doing all that, he came to our suite to check on us and offer his assistance, but we were all packed. The next thing I knew, we were safely in the car, heading for the airport. What amazing service!\nAs I said at the beginning, I wish I could have stayed longer and whenever I am in NYC, you may find me at the Chatwal Hotel.", "author": {"username": "Queenjo", "num_reviews": 4, "id": "0C65643A9DE3473BBB7C0625DB71B6AF", "location": ""}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 1641016, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 3, 2012", "id": 139279635, "via_mobile": false}

The rooms are decorated in a modern clean style but the fittings are not of a high quality and already have a lot of damage. The carpets were a neutral cream colour and were stained badly. The location, versus the price, versus the experience dont add up! The gym is a room with no windows and no atmosphere. Its dark and not inspiring to train. This is a shame as there is some good equipment. I trained in there once and then went to another local gym.

The hotel is very nice and modern. There are lots of little touches that set it apart, like providing free beverages when you arrive, free beverages and snacks in your room, and a free wine happy hour in the evenings. The restaurant was very good, with very good service. The location is also very central near the library and Bryant Park. \nOur check in was great. We arrived about noon and our room was not ready. We were given coffee and sparkling water while bags were checked in. Kelly took great care of us. Later Amy brought us to our room and also took great care of us. The room was larger, modern with a lounge couch, with a slight view of the Library down the street, but near the elevators. It seemed like a nice modern styled room, which we like. Then night time came. I could hear a high pitched noise from behind the walls that had been covered up by New York traffic during the day. And the noise was even worse deeper in the room and bathroom, away from the windows. I took my Ambient sleeping pill to try and block it out, but only got about four hours sleep and woke up to a splitting headache from the noise. Since we were staying three nights, I asked my husband to talk to the front desk about moving us to a new room. He was told the hotel was full and that they would send up an 'engineer' to look at the problem. Unless they were going to break through walls, I knew the problem could not be fixed by a handyman they would send up. I checked on Hyatt's website and found out they had lied to my husband because the hotel was not full. Next we both went down to the front desk to confront the man (sorry don't know his name) about the dishonesty and to let him know this problem was beyond a handyman repair problem. As I was trying to express my thoughts about the situation he kept saying 'I hear what you are saying, I hear what you are saying' which could not be true because he kept interrupting me and cutting me off from trying to tell him what I was saying. Finally he left and Kelly, the great and very professional lady who checked us in, came and took care of everything. She didn't question our need to move, tell us it was an engineering problem, lie about the hotel being full, or argue with us in any way. She just very gracefully took care of the problem. While we went out and enjoyed the day, she had our bags moved to another room (no high pitched noise, away from the elevators) and she also had a complementary bottle of champagne sent up. Kelly took a very bad situation that would have had us checking out of the hotel that day, and turned the rest of our stay into a wonderful experience. Instead of us being upset about the bad room and poor treatment, we instead had a very nice stay thanks to her. She is a real asset to the hotel, very professional and personable.\nRegarding the staff and the wine happy hour, it is also spotty. Our first night, (Thursday Sept 27th), a lady was working the happy hour area. She saw us come in but she was having a conversation with a customer (about the California coast) so we sat there for over 10 minutes without any acknowledgement we were there. Finally my husband went into the lobby to ask for assistance and Amy, the nice and professional lady who took us to our room, came in and served us wine. The the lady who left us waiting for service gave us dirty looks after this, like we had done something wrong. The next night however, we went to the wine happy hour and received excellent service from a very friendly man. He was three times busier than the lady from the night before but was giving everyone great friendly service. \nOur waiter in the restaurant was also very good, professional, friendly and efficient. It was nice having a very good restaurant in the hotel, especially after exhausting days in New York.\nThis is a very good hotel with good amenities, some great service and some poor service.

Be sure and check out the Tavern's Keep cocktail bar on the first floor - they serve 1800-1920s era classic cocktails, with top notch ingredients and great presentation.\nThe front desk staff was good enough, but Vanessa, the Chief Concierge was fabulous. She took care of all of the tasks I needed done in advance - arranging car service for us from Newark, getting a reservation at one of the finest restaurants in NYC for our anniversary, printing out Empire State Building tickets, etc. She even took care of a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for our anniversary - very nice.\nThe combination of location of the hotel, cleanliness and ammenities, and professionalism of staff made The Iroquois Hotel the perfect choice.

(44th between 5th and 6th ave).\nAs such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District.\nIf you don't mind the walk, Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over).\nWe however, found that many of the places we wanted to visit, required a short cab ride (Chelsea, West Village, Lincoln Center). Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive - plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days.\nIf you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life, this area is to be avoided. If you enjoy hustle and bustle - the centre of the action is right here. Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel - if you are at the front of the building, you need to be high up.\nWe stayed in two different rooms. The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor - it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room.\nThis room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out. The decor however, was extremely nice. \nWe extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor. This consisted of a lounge with two sofas, a desk and two armchairs, a chest of drawers, some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge. Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed, plus an armchair with footstool, a chaise long style bench, a chest of drawers, a couple of tables and another large TV. Also a very thin closet. The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes.\nWe loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in. I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house.\nOne major drawback for us, was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms. At some point in the past, the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room, leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps, picture spots etc). At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting! In our first room, we asked for an extra lamp - which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs, so not a complete solution.\nThe service in this hotel was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff. This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations.\nOther small but nice features of this hotel, are the switches on the back of the door, which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green, so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service.\nThe library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers, plus computers with internet.

We had high expectations given the trusted recommendation and that Joel Freyburg's (the GM) assistant assured my husband that we would be treated like VIPs for our special trip. I have to say that I was very let down. First let me recognize the hotel for all that was great about it. The location is fantastic- close to Time Square but on a quiet street that allows you to escape. The design and furnishings in the hotel were top notch. The hotel had an art deco feel in the lobby and the room was well appointed and the furniture, appliances/technology was first class. There was a TV built into the bathroom vanity which surprisingly I enjoyed. There was a rain shower and also a hand held- very nice shower but more to tell on that in a moment.... And my favorite feature was the toilet. I know it sounds crazy but the seats were heated and the bidet was perfect! And lastly the spa was great and my massage was excellent. \nSo where did it fall short you ask? The service (with the exception of the bell and door men who were great). All presented a friendly aim to please spirit and the white gloves were a nice touch but the service fell apart in the execution. It started upon my arrival. Our room wasn't ready which was fine so I asked the concierge for a spa recommendation. I did not know they had a spa in the hotel and his response was \"Well what about our spa, is it too expensive?\". Rule number one, never assume anything about someone's finances. I ended up going to the spa in the hotel and that is when the second incident occurred. After my massage I asked if I could go up to my room in the spa robe. The spa agreed and called to the front desk to have my keys brought down to the spa so that I would not have to go to the main lobby. We waited for 25 minutes for my key that never arrived (after 2 additional calls to the front desk) and finally I had to go and get my own key in my robe. The third incident was that I did not know how to make the shower water warm (not the hotel's fault) so on the first night of our stay we called for help and they said they would send someone up. After waiting and hearing nothing I took a cold shower. I called early that next morning and the engineer was not in, so once again I could not get help with the shower until after we were scheduled to leave for our breakfast reservation so I took my second cold shower that am. I am assuming that the engineer did fix the shower because it worked great that evening but after 2 cold showers you would think someone would let us know that it was handled and ensure that we knew how to use the shower appropriately. At this point I was done. \nThe final kicker for me was that when asked if we enjoyed our stay the day of our departure, I politely expressed my dissatisfaction and the lady at the front desk kindly apologized and asked to make it up to us on our next visit. While I believe she was sincere, offering to rectify an issue on some future date that may never occur is a service faux pas. You can not assume you will get a second chance to make something right.

If you can get rooms for $119-$130 a night, it is extremely worth it. Hopefully they don't raise them too high, but this hotel could probably easily be priced much higher, but then again they are the experts so they know what they're doing. They attracted me, didn't they? \nWe stayed a Friday and Saturday night, three day weekend in Houston. The only major downside would have to be that it's on the Katy Freeway, so coming in on Friday from the east can be a pain, unless you take the beltway around. Exit I-10 East from the Beltway all the way on the west side of town and you get your own dedicated exit to Gessner and the hotel. Made things much easier than coming across straight on I-10. \nValet parking isn't cheap. You can park yourself for cheaper. But the valet staff was really helpful and professional. You won't be disappointed using them. \nChecking in was about as painless as I've ever experienced, plus they registered me into their rewards program too, didn't take long at all. The elevators are key access above the third floor for added security. Most modern hotels have this. \nThe room was only a traditional yet it was much larger than I was imagining. On the 7th floor. It had an excellent view, large floor to ceiling windows. It had a good size refrigerator. The bathroom shower had two shower heads. The tub didn't drain very quickly, but it wasn't an issue for me. Also, the phone calls to valet were very staticy. Wish wifi or computer access was free. Read that it wasn't, but we didn't use it, so I can't totally say for certain. \nThere is an open patio area on the 18th floor, hot tub, infinity pool that is 3-4 feet, large sitting area and fitness area. It was really nice and the breeze for a late spring day was great. In winter, it could get cold up there. \nI didn't eat in the hotel besides the bar snacks so I can't rate the food. The bar, 024, was superb. Great service and drinks for reasonable prices to other major bars in major cities. \nThe location is really great. It's off Gessner at Memorial City Mall. There is a skybridge to the mall. They have Target, Macy's, Apple Store, sports stores, etc. For food, they have a food court, plus a sports bar, California Pizza Kitchen, Cheesecake Factory and a Tex Mex place although it was more like line up service, not a traditional restaurant. \nNoise wasn't an issue in the room. I heard an ambulance once for the nearby hospital. Storms came through and although I could see the lightning, I never heard the thunder. The beds are very comfortable, a ton of pillows, too many for me. And the bedspread kind of got me hot but I just kicked it off. The bed itself was very comfortable. Huge flat panel tv also with a lot of channels. \nOn the weekend, the drive on the Katy wasn't a problem at all into the city. You won't regret staying here, especially for the price. I'd say anything under $180-200 is good, under $130-140 is great at this place.", "author": {"username": "DW W", "num_cities": 14, "num_helpful_votes": 27, "num_reviews": 40, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "9376279643376CF0F1673C1089AB6371", "location": "Baton Rouge, LA"}, "date_stayed": "May 2012", "offering_id": 1966350, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "May 17, 2012", "id": 130135518, "via_mobile": false}

They state that they will give you the \"best room available\" However, at Andaz they gave me most likely one of the worst. It was very small, with a view on an ugly inner court and worn-out furniture.\nOn top of it, most of the waiters at the restaurant on the ground floor are rude and unhelpful. Even though they can easily charge up to $200 per person for dinner, the quality of service is not there.

When I gave them a call, they told me that it was for breakfast on our last day. And they were genuinely surprised when I told them that breakfast is always complimentary for diamond members.

I got in at supper time and had to call for delivery from a pizza place nearby that had a pretty limited menu.\nThe indoor pool is quite small and is located right next to a sitting area in the lobby so unless you want to be on display while you swim, it's not really useful.\nIf I go back to Houston, I'll probably opt for a hotel in the downtown core, and one that has an in-house restaurant.", "author": {"username": "kstevens", "num_cities": 2, "num_helpful_votes": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "location": "St. John's", "id": "93736A77376583CC17DD02D96FF9EB37"}, "date_stayed": "March 2008", "offering_id": 239853, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "March 21, 2008", "id": 14433843, "via_mobile": false}

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, greeted by Debbie Bunn, it was a wonderful experience! ALL the family and friends stayed at the hotel. The Rehearsal Dinner and Cocktail Hour before were perfection! YIPPPEEEE! A business that KNOWS their business and does it to....yep! Perfection!!!! More to say about the Hilton Garden Inn......I delivered 22 baskets to the hotel on Wednesday before the wedding. Family and friends began arriving on Thursday and would arrive all the way through to Saturday afternoon. Each and every person received their basket at check-in AND received the correct basket. (Each basket was made for each family in mind.) We're off to a great start! Then, following my dad's birthday celebration at Texas Land and Cattle (already heard that story, did ya?).....we all went back to the hotel and we took over the bar area, stayed around past the time the bar was to close and the bartender told us...no problem! No Problem....I'm sorry, I am just not used to that selfless, customer service oriented behavior....AMAZING!!!!! \nFriday....family and friends still arriving...hotel handling everything smoothly. Shuttle took family and friends to the mall and picked them up again....and was prompt! I arrived at 3:00 to begin decorating the hall. Jennifer is the event planner for the hotel. Another \"Can Do\" person. How could there possibly be that many GOOD people in one place? The room was set up, Marco was there to run everywhere around the hotel for me, finding everything that I requested....HE should be the CEO of Hilton! That guy is over the top! The room was super fun with all the Texas decorations, and the details were all taken care of by Jennifer, Marco and the hotel staff. The cocktail hour was a hit and the appetizers were excellent! They even set up our own little bar! The Barbeque and all the fixins' were superb! People were still talking about it on Saturday! We finally \"let\" Marco and the waitstaff go home about 10:30. They never complained! Just said it was a wonderful event! THE ENTIRE NIGHT AMAZING!!!! THEY WERE AMAZING!!! Once again, we all stayed at the hotel bar area and the lounge area for a while longer. Did the bartender complain? Nope! Sure didn't! What is this hotel feeding its staff? Happiness, Loyalty, Appreciation? Maybe....just maybe.....what a novel idea! Saturday night....Wedding is over, all is well at the hotel. Everyone is resting, including my hubby and myself. They comped us a room for Friday and Saturday night, so if we wanted to be with family, we could. Really? Giving us something for nothing....noooooo way! WAY!!!!!!! We got up on Sunday morning, met everyone for breakfast. They gave us the back area, so that we could all be together and then we all broke bread together as family. It was a wonderful ending to a wonderful weekend. I truly am almost in tears thinking about and writing about \"our\" wonderful hotel. They joined my family that weekend. They were as happy and excited for us, as we were. From the bottom of my heart, I thank you Hilton. God's blessings upon each and everyone of you, and much, much success always.

I'm the trip planner and I always try to find a different area for us to stay in. This year, it was the Upper West Side. My research showed that the Beacon was the best deal for the dates of our trip. October is a very expensive time to come to New York so when I was able to find a 1 bedroom suite for less than 400.00 a night, I made the reservation.\nThe hotel is in a lovely, residential area of New York. When I win the lottery, that's exactly the area I want to live in! We arrived at the hotel at about 10:00 AM on Friday, Oct.5th after a very long cab ride from LGA. Note to self- don't plan our next trip to NYC to arrive during rush hour. Lucky for us, our room was ready when we checked in. The manager on duty was David. He took such good care of us during our stay. This was our 8th annual girl's trip to NYC and as I mentioned we always stay in a different area. The service at this hotel was the best we've ever experienced.\nThe suite was lovely. Our room was on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the city. The queen bed was so comfortable and the living area had a pull-out couch and a roll-a-way was sent up for us, which was a nice touch. Loved the fully stocked kitchen. The hotel has been renovated recently and our suite was immaculate. One of my favorite things was having a delicious cup of coffee each morning. There is a Fairway market directly across the street and a wine store next door. Very convenient!\nWe had a wonderful trip to NYC as always. Had tickets for the Kelly and Michael show, Jimmy Fallon, Huckabee, and saw an Off-Broadway show, Cougar the Musical. Walked the entire High Line at night, went to Chelsea Market, shopping at Macy's,and had some great pizza in Soho just to name a few of the highlights.\nPlanning another trip to this great city in January, with my husband this time.

We were greeted immediatelyin the lobby with a warm hello and offer of a beverage. Checkin was smooth and since we were just a few minutes early we had to waitfor just a few minuteswhile the hostess checked with housekeeping to ensure our room was ready. We waited in a comfortable area just off the lobby and discovered a nook with 5 full shelves of hardcover novels to borrow during our stay. We were escorted to our room and the staff took time to walk us through the cool features of our \"space\" including touchpad light switches, shower with 3 options (footbath, rainhead or handheld) and the nicest bath sheet towels to wrap up in. The blackout shades would roll down with a touch of a button and we were lucky enough to have a small kitchenette area that included a fridge, freezer,microwave and mini coffee maker that made a nice cup of espresso. This area was stcked with soda and other drinks, I enjoyed the large bottle of organic green tea and my teen loved the fizzy organic soda, the Cocacola was just not as cool! In addition there were kettle cooked potato chips, a dark chocolate bar and one of the most delicious granola bars I've ever had. I saved the package so I can research them on line and order from this local N Y manufacturer. The best part is these snacks are that they are free and replenished each day. In addition,if you visit the lobby there is always coffee, tea, fruit and even wine at a nightly 6pm reception. Prior to our stay the hotel sent an email reminding me of our upcoming stay and asked if there was anything they ould do to make our tay more comfortable. I did respond and let them know we were there to celebrate my daughters birthday- on Friday there was a knock on our door and compliments of the hotel a beautiful piece of chocolate cake arrived with a personalized birthday card wishing her a happy day. All these touches made us feel welcomed and at home during our stay. After a hectic day of touring and running around we splurged on room service at 11pm (the hot dog from a street vendor at 5 was just NOT dinner, but shopping was her 16 yr old focus). The room service staff was courteous, eager to please and prompt. The Andaz is a great value for the money and I do p,an to return, it would ake a great trip with my husband as the hotel has a great bar (whichi was not able to visit this trip) and a nice location.

You really have to be looking for the hotel to know that it is there and once you are arrive it is not entirely clear as to where you enter. You enter the hotel into a very small lobby. Off to the right of the lobby is a nice seating area that I think the Andaz refers to as the Library. To the right of the lobby are bar height tables and chairs . Eight of us ended up gathering here for complimentary wine during Happy Hour. We checked in around 3pm and our rooms were still not ready. This was a little disappointing since I had requested an early check in but in their defense I was told that they were fully booked the previous evening. \nUnlike traditional Hyatt's where there are clearly defined roles (i.e.. concierge, bellman, reception, etc.) the Andaz seems to employ generalists. The same person that checked me in also stored my bags, brought the luggage to my suite and later served us wine in the lobby. The staff goes out of their way to remember your name and did greet us personally several times throughout our visit. This was very impressive\nThe suite was of decent size by NYC standards and had modern decor. The room had a small fridge, microwave and even a dishwasher that were all concealed behind modern cabinetry. The Andaz provides a small quantity of complimentary snacks and beverages in the room. The living area had a very comfortable couch that folded out into an amazingly comfortable sleeper. The high quality King size mattress and high thread count linens made for a comfortable nights sleep. The bathroom is probably the highlight of the accommodations. The walk in rain shower provided seemingly endless hot water. \nI have read some reviews that suggested that this might not be the most ideal location for families. In general I would agree but did notice that there were a number of travelers accompanied by well mannered children. We had our kids with us and they enjoyed the stay. Outside of the room itself there really isn't anything onsite that children would be drawn to but we were there to tour the city. \nThe restaurant is very small for a hotel of this size. We had to wait about 10 min for a table for breakfast. The food is tasty, locally sourced (in some cases) and very fresh. This property does not have a Regency Club and as such offers Diamond status guests a $75 food credit each day. This sounds like a lot but and is very generous but keep in mind $75 will likely feed 2 at breakfast. \nIf you are looking for a grand lobby or a wide array of activities this is not the place for you.

It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.\nStaff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.\nDuring our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.\nIn summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep. But it did not provide me with that feeling of a place that goes above and beyond, though the bell boys certainly do!", "author": {"username": "erhel", "num_cities": 7, "num_helpful_votes": 9, "num_reviews": 15, "num_type_reviews": 7, "id": "04E9B6780687473E3E746FC650D34461", "location": "Stockholm, Sweden"}, "date_stayed": "August 2012", "offering_id": 93396, "num_helpful_votes": 1, "date": "September 18, 2012", "id": 140626688, "via_mobile": false}

We were ushered into a separate check-in area and quickly shown to our spacious and elegant apartment which featured a fully equipped galley kitchen, living room with dining table, bedroom and bathroom. While we would never have splurged to upgrade ourselves, it was a wonderful perk. The hotel is older, perhaps a bit dated (could be considered \"classic\"), but seems to be well kept up. The service was exceptional: we enjoyed complimentary newspapers, coffee and delicious breakfast pastries each morning in the Residence's lobby and appreciated all the advice and help with dinner reservations from the concierge. The valet at the main hotel lobby was extremely accommodating and arranged to have the hotel's car and driver take us to a conference event that was a few miles away. One of the highlights of our stay was the Tuesday evening wine tasting event in the Four Seasons wine bar, Vinoteca. We enjoyed four or five generous pours of excellent Italian wines and when my husband remarked that he particularly liked one of them, the waitress came and poured him a full glass! When we returned home we we looked up the wine he had liked so much and found it to be a bottle that sells for $85! There was also a delicious buffet of Italian cheese and fruits and crackers to accompany the wine. Very, very enjoyable! I walked through the smallish pool area and it would have been inviting if not for the stifling heat (well over a hundred.) The one downside to our stay: it always aggravates me to have to pay extra for internet access and the Four Seasons charges a daily fee for internet.\nThe comfortable accommodations were especially appreciated when we left the hotel to find the downtown area highly depressing: soulless architecture, somewhat desolate and grungy, and full of panhandlers. We were not 20 feet from the hotel when we were approached by a man claiming to have car trouble and looking for a handout. We took the light rail out to the museum area and Rice University just to look around and get the lay of the land but the extreme heat in June did not allow us to explore much. We ended up taking the downtown underground tunnels back toward the hotel to get out of the heat and noted very few open businesses and lots of closed/empty storefronts. Houston's downtown seems to have seen better times.

Furthermore, when we asked for more information on the call bill (they gave us the time, not the duration of the calls), the man at reception got quite annoyed and basically implied that we must be idiots if we can't see that the international calls are what cost so much (yes...! but can you tell us how you got to the cost please? the duration?? the rate???). No matter what we said, he just kept saying that it was all written on the bill (on the bill was actually the time of the calls, written in 24 hour time) and the rate is whatever unknown rate they are charged (probably using gold cables being exchanged through luxembourg) plus 75% and scoffing and waving the bill away. He would have clearly seen this was not the case if he'd chosen to listen to us rather than scoffing at our stupidity and gesturing to talk to the hand. Absolutely get a phone card even if, like us, you have no intention of making calls anyway. Or, just use your foreign mobile, its actually WAY cheaper.

We stayed with our two young children, aged 2 and 3 years old and the location is fantastic. You can easily walk to loads of child-friendly attractions including the children's museum, the natural history museum, central park and even the Met by walking through the park. All the museums and galleries also run children's programming so there's even more to them than just looking at the exhibits.\nThe kitchens were VERY basically supplied so even though they say that you have a full kitchen, you can't really cook much. There are no dishes/pans suitable for the oven so its completely redundant. There are also no dishes suitable for cooking food in the microwave... except maybe 4 small plates, 4 dinner plates and 4 shallow cereal bowls. I suppose you could heat a TV dinner in the packaging it comes in or heat baby food etc, otherwise you're completely limited to what you can produce on the stove with a small frypan, one spatula and one small saucepan.\nThe hotel suggests that you contact the Babysitters Guild direct for babysitting services, which we did and we absolutely loved our sitter whose name was Amy.\nThe doormen are lovely and will receive parcels for you if you shop up a storm and need to have things delivered.\nThere is a very handy coin-operated laundry room on one of the floors which costs $1.75 for each box of detergent, wash or dry load.\nThe rooms are small but furnished nicely.

Finally I did assure myself that they did not have any and I would have to find some myself. I walked to two Duane Reade Drugs stores that had no distilled water and finally had to go to a Walgreens in Times Square. I forgive you for not having it but please tell me where I can purchase some. I did attempt to call the hotel manager, not because I was upset but I thought that he should know the operator trying to protect the manager gave me the voice mail of his number two. Not good! You too should not have a tie.\nA $75 breakfast was included with our reservation. Hard to believe $75, but again it was New York and I think an omelet was $17. On our last day we checked out early so they could get the room ready for the next reservation, even though we had about two hours until check out time and when we needed to leave. When I got home I looked at our credit card statement and found $89 charged to our bill for breakfast. $14 above the allowed $75, first how could that be and second why was this not included.

Trash piles up on side streets and most of the surrounding buildings are active warehouses. Lastly, the bathrooms in the suites feature a barn style door on sliders. This very heavy barn door became derailed and trapped two members of our party in the bathroom for several minutes, while the third member of our party was out of the room. Beauty and practicality must come together.\nThe hotel's pricing is about average for New York.\nI recommend this hotel if this is your desired location.", "author": {"username": "westcon", "num_cities": 13, "num_helpful_votes": 8, "num_reviews": 16, "num_type_reviews": 12, "id": "F183F4E71241F709D4466FF6A828A366", "location": "Chicago, Illinois"}, "date_stayed": "November 2011", "offering_id": 1456560, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "October 25, 2012", "id": 143661003, "via_mobile": false}

The rooms are well designed for the size and had a really comfortable, white duvet bed, large flat screen TV, mini bar, safe, desk and two chairs. The decent sized marble bathroom featured a wide vanity and a large shower with teak seat and Etro toiletries. Floor to ceiling windows even had a look-up-to-the-left view of the Empire State Building. Housekeeping twice a day was great and scheduled around us without issue. \nThe negatives: Our room was not ready, which isn't totally inconceivable at 1:00, but the desk attendant didn't seem the least bit welcoming or concerned about our inconvenience--especially since we arrived during a rain storm. First impressions are the most important and I guess we got off to a bad start. Other staff members were friendlier. The hotel decor is comprised of dark grays, black and browns which gave off a dingy vibe in some areas. Lack of sufficient lighting in the room compounded the problem.

The towels were so worn and thin that I thought their sandpaper-like quality might exfoliate my entire body without ever really drying it. Really, it was like a bad summer camp experience.

As a (somewhat disgruntled ) Starwood Platinum member, I have been giving Kimpton a serious try. Most of their hotels are wonderful. Eventi just does not make the grade. The staff for the most part are very gracious. But something is always just not quite right here. My first visit they had some sort of water pipe break which flooded some guest rooms. They gallantly and apologetically put me on a steeper sofa for the night. OK, stuff happens--I understand. The next trip here they somehow cancelled my room--yes I was late, but I had told them I would be late, but they did get me a room and sent a very nice amenity to the room. I kind of decided this one would be chalked up to my fault: I was late arriving. The third visit started out great. An upgrade to a suite by a wonderfully gracious friendly welcome staff. I get to my floor and there are dirty room service trays everywhere. This is at 4:15 PM. One has to order ice here from room service. 25 minutes later and 3 calls it finally arrives. When I complained there was an excuse about the ice has to come from the resturant. I asked if the NYC garbage collection department was responsible for collecting half day old room service litter in the hallways, and asked for the general manager to call me. Yes- I admit my happiness with the suite upgrade had faded now in the face of inattentive service. \nSo my advice: great location, very friendly staff, nice rooms, but the attention to detail leaves a bit to be desired. My experience here makes me re-think my plan to leave Starwood for Kimpton, but I have to admit other Kimpton properties have been quite wonderful.

The location was wonderful, my family and I stayed there for a convention and the hotel like others said is directly connected. Perfect. The green buses that run downtown are right there as well and I LOVED the Hilton Downtown Shuttle as well. We utilized both and found them very helpful. We also went to an Astro game which was within walking distance and it was fun you could see all the excitement from outside our room which had a gorgeous view of the park. \nThe employees we encountered from Front Desk, Starbucks, Breakfast place, Bell Desk etc were all so nice, helpful and went above and beyond. A+ job to everyone!! I am huge on customer service, and I was really pleased. I am a Hilton Honors member as well and was very pleased with the service I received with that as well.\nThe room was typical, clean and I loved the pole in the shower so you could hang a towel or steam clothes. Used it every day!! I did encounter a problem (not the Hilton's fault, it was drunk people from a wedding being held there on that Saturday) and the Hilton took care of it. Wonderful time in Houston, so much to do and this Hilton made our trip so much better!!", "author": {"username": "lovept", "num_cities": 22, "num_helpful_votes": 29, "num_reviews": 47, "num_type_reviews": 26, "id": "AB70A22DAAA3D0A73A21C167F0002293", "location": "Fresno, California"}, "date_stayed": "September 2012", "offering_id": 282699, "num_helpful_votes": 0, "date": "September 19, 2012", "id": 140724944, "via_mobile": false}

The location is close to downtown--walking distance about 6 city blocks--and felt relatively safe. There is a decent happy hour for registered guests; a small, but nice workout room; and free computer access and printing, which I appreciated to print out my boarding pass. The bed was extremely comfortable and nice. My only complaint is that the desk staff was not particularly forthcoming about the free shuttle service it provides to the downtown area. It's fast and free, but only runs during the day. At check-in, I asked about my conference location for the next morning and was told it was an easy 7-block walk. But, of course, I had luggage, etc., so I wasn't too thrilled with that news. No mention was made of the shuttle service. When I checked out the info in the room, I saw the shuttle service and called the front desk. I confirmed that the service was available. I was amused that the person who advised about the \"easy\" walk was my shuttle driver. Nonetheless, a good place for a quick overnighter.
